`　僕の心を掴んで離さなかった\"彼女\"は、\r\n　異世界のお姫様でも、ひとりぼっちの少女でも、\r\n　生まれながらに差をつけられるショウ者でもなく、幼馴染みの\"青年\"だった――\r\n\r\n　朝の日差しがわずかに残る気持ちの良い時間帯、僕は片付けが一段落すると姉が淹れてくれたお茶で一息つく。\r\n　「そっちはどう？ヴァレン。」\r\n　姉さんが尋ねてくるのに僕は頷いて「だいぶ片付いたから、もう少し」と言葉にしようとしたが、扉の開閉音に視線をとられて音にはならなかった。\r\n　「よう、ヴァレン、タナ。」\r\n　「ナセル！」\r\n　後ろより少しだけ長い横髪を揺らして彼は挨拶をする。ナセルは僕の幼馴染みだ。\r\n　彼と出会ったのは確か―１２年ほど前だったろうか。家々の隙間をぬって入り込める小道の先の小さな空き地の木の下で、彼は気持ち良さそうに眠っていた。出会ってからはすぐに仲良くなって、暇さえあれば連れだって遊びに行くのだ。\r\n　とはいえ。\r\n　姉さんがナセルへ腰かけるよう誘うと、反対に僕は椅子から立ち上がる。どうかしたのかと彼が口を曲げる。\r\n　「僕は片付けを終わらせるよ。じゃ、ごゆっくり。」\r\n　にこりと笑顔を作る。お前な、と苦笑いを返された。茶碗だけ流しへ運んで、自室への階段を上る。だって邪魔者は退散するのが一番いいだろう？ナセルと姉さんは恋仲なのだ。３、４年前に彼が恥ずかしそうに打ち明けたのを、ちょうど１階へ降りてくるタイミングと重なって聞いてしまったのだ。けど別に驚きはあまりなかった。それよりもむしろ応援している。姉さんも彼のことは気に入っていたようだし、中々似合いなのではないのだろうか。\r\n\r\n　片付けを終わらせたのは予想通りの時間。本当にあと少し、整理した箱を押し入れにしまい床を掃除する程度だったのだから。もう少し何かで暇を潰そうとして、階下から声が聞こえた。\r\n　「ヴァレン、かい物行ってきてくれる？」\r\n　降りていって、もうナセルは帰ったのかと聞けば姉は静かに頷いた。\r\n　「用事を思い出しちゃったみたい。」\r\n　全く、暇だからやってきたのではなかったのか。彼のその気まぐれさというべきか、計画性のなさは相変わらず。\r\n　鞄とメモを受け取って靴を履き、行ってきますと扉を開けた。道中紙を見下ろせば食材がいくつか書かれていた。…うん、これなら店道で揃いそうだ。\r\n\r\n　大通りへ差し掛かる。歩く人影が増えてきた。かい物へ行く人、散歩する人、誰かと待ち合わせている人…今日も今日とて平和だなぁ、と足取りも軽くなる。と、\r\n　青い柱の街灯の下に見覚えのある姿を見つける。様子から何かを待っているようだった。\r\n　「ナセル。」僕はそう声をかけたが人混みに紛れて届いていないようであった。まだ昼頃であるし、家からさほど距離はない…目的の店が並ぶ道とは別へ通じる前ではあったけれど、彼のもとへと駆けていった。\r\n　が。\r\n　僕より早く、彼のもとへ少女が現れる。\r\n　―？\r\n　茶髪をくるりと内へ巻いて正面へ出し、フリルをあしらいながらもどこか控えめな服を着た女性に、顔の見える距離ではあったけれど、見覚えがなかった。顔も色合いも似ていないから親族ではないだろう、友達だろうか。昔から知っているとはいえ、別に毎日顔を会わせているわけではない。彼はとても気まぐれで、予告なしに遊びに来るし、気分が乗らないと約束も無駄にする。彼女が僕の知らぬ別の友達であってもおかしくはない。―なのに、とても嫌な予感がした。\r\n　彼らは笑い合って何事かを話していた。雑踏で聞こえはしなかったがおそらく決まり文句の待ち時間問答だろう。すぐに終わらせて近くの通りへと歩き出していく。\r\n　――――あ！\r\n　少女は何の迷いもなく、ナセルの腕を自らの両腕で抱きしめるようにくっつくと、顔もこてりと彼の胸へ寄せた。彼は嫌がる素振りも見せない。\r\n　理解が追いつかずに自然と首が横へ折れる。何度も瞬きしてようやく、彼らがすでに立ち去ってしまったことを認識した。\r\n\r\n　「ヴァレン？どうかしたの。」\r\n　呼びかけに顔を上げたものの、僕の思考は相変わらず先ほど目にしてしまった光景にとらわれていた。\r\n　姉さんには、用事があるだのと説明しておいて、その裏では別の人間と会っていた。急に呼び出しがあったのかは知らないが、彼らの仲は、おそらく「友人」ではない。\r\n　「ヴァレン！」\r\n　どんと肩に衝撃が走る。タナが自分を揺らしたようだ。\r\n　「あ…ごめん、何か用？」\r\n　「箸、進んでないわよ？どうしたの、一体。」\r\n　見渡せば僕の方の食器にばかり食べ物が残っている。遅めの昼食の最中であった。\r\n　「い、いや…何でもないよ。」\r\n　「美味しくなかったかしら。」\r\n　「そんなことないってっ！ちょっと、考え事していただけで…」\r\n　先程のことは…言った方が良いのだろうか。料理を詰め込むように口に入れながらまた、そんなことを考える。\r\n　姉さんは立ち上がると食事の片付けを始めた。鼻歌まじりに食事器具を片していく。そんな後ろ姿を見ていたら、黙っている方がよっぽど悲しみを生む気がして。\r\n　「あのさ、姉さん。」\r\n　「なあに？」\r\n　彼女は振り向かずに言葉だけで答える。\r\n　「ナセルとは…どう？」\r\n　「どうって…何、いきなり…」\r\n　しかしそこまで言うと、何かに気づいたように顔をかすかに上げた。\r\n　「午前中のこと？別に喧嘩したわけじゃないわよ。」\r\n　「え？いや、そうじゃなくて。」\r\n　僕は一呼吸置いて、先ほど彼を見たのだと話した。姉さんより年下の少女と、仲良く歩いていたと。話の途中でちらとだけ彼女の様子をうかがったが、変わらず食器を洗っている。驚いた様子も怒っている様子もなく、まるで世間話をしているだけのように。\r\n　「…気にならないの。」\r\n　蛇口が閉められ、水流の音が消えていく。\r\n　「別人だと思うわ。」\r\n　姉さんは振り向くと、にっこりとそう告げた。\r\n　「けど…」\r\n　「別の人よ。…あなたが気にする必要なんてないの。さ、午後は何をしましょうか…」\r\n　そう言い残して、彼女は自室の扉を開けた。僕はもう一度思い出して、そんなことはないと思うけど、と聞こえないようにつぶやいた。\r\n\r\n　少し離れた空き地に、遊劇団がやってきたから遊びに行こうと言い出したのはいつものごとく彼であったが、約束を当日になって忘れてサボるのも、相変わらず彼の方であった。\r\n　「全く…」\r\n　「仕方がないわよ。急に何かあったのかもしれないし。」\r\n　「もう、姉さんも甘いんだよ。今の世の中だからいいものの…」\r\n　姉さんが笑ってすましてしまうのもいつもの…というよりは、ここ2，3年であろうか。以前は彼女とて約束を頻繁に破棄する彼を、そういう人物であると理解しながらも注意していた。ところがここ最近はあきらめたのか、彼に彼女が合わせることが圧倒的に多い。\r\n　結局始まってしまった演技を姉弟で見終わり、あれがよかったとかここはわからなかっただとか感想を述べあって帰路につく。途中のどが渇いたなと僕だけ喫茶店へ足を運び、姉さんは家へと帰っていった。\r\n　ふう、と一息つく。HC-Z-497が店を走り回っていた。僕はニルで抽出したと書かれた特性ジョフを頼む。やがて湯気が香りをカップから天井へと持ち上げながら運ばれてきた。なるほどここの主人は接客よりも厨房に力を入れているだけはある。そこまで詳しいわけではないけれど飲みやすさが機械の作るそれとは格段に違って、ニルへ葉が溶け出したみたいに、それらが一つのものとして存在を確立しているのが初めてわかったような気がした。\r\n　そんな風に昼下がりを楽しんで、通りのよく見える大きな窓に何気なく視線を移す。\r\n　ひらりと、花びらが舞った。\r\n　いいや違う。花ではない。通りを歩く人々の群れに、風になびくスカートを見たのだ。その主は誰かと楽しそうに歩いている。相手の方に見覚えはなかった。\r\n　けれどもその\"彼女\"は、間違いなくナセルであった――\r\n\r\n　「だから、悪かったって！！」\r\n　黒にも近い木造の建物は、彼とはよく行く店の一つであった。夕方からのみではあるが酒を頼むこともできる。\r\n　「ふーん、どうせ反省してないんでしょ？」\r\n　「ぐ…反省なんかしたって、どうせ次もやるし…」\r\n　「だからそれを反省してないって言うんだって…」\r\n　全く…どんな言い訳だ。ため息をついて、僕はまだ良いけどと付け加える。\r\n　「姉さんには迷惑かけないでよね。」\r\n　「わーってるけど…」\r\n　彼は運ばれてきたカップをぐいと飲み干す。\r\n　「しゃーねーだろ…寝てたんだから。」\r\n　「アラームかけなかったの？」\r\n　「どうせ聞きゃしねーからなー」\r\n　本当に反省していないのだろう、にこにことそんな調子で続ける彼に、長いつきあいではあるけど、改めて呆れる。素直なのかひねくれているのか…それとも本音を隠すため、だろうか。\r\n　「ねえ、ナセル。本当のことを言ってよ。」\r\n　「ん？」\r\n　彼は寝ていたと言ったけれど、僕はその日に歩いている彼を見かけているのだ。それも…\r\n　「知られるのが嫌なのかもしれないけどさ、嘘つく方が良くないと思う。僕、見たんだよね。」\r\n　「お…おいおい、何の話だ？」\r\n　彼は額に汗を浮かべて苦笑いした。\r\n　「ちょっと前に…ほら、片付けをしているって言った日と、遊撃団のとき。君を見たんだよ。…姉さんじゃない人と、そういう風に仲良く歩いている君をさ…」\r\n　思い出して腹が立ってきた。コップに一口つけて自分を落ち着かせる。彼を伺えば、困惑したような、冷めたような、なんともとれて何もわからない表情をしていた。\r\n　「……」\r\n　「…ナセル？」\r\n　「……悪い、全く、ワカラン。」\r\n　指を折って何かを数え始め、時折物を動かすような仕草を取ったがすぐに頭を抱えると観念したようにこちらへ謝ってきた。けれども僕の期待していた謝罪ではなかった。\r\n　「あー…わかんねえ。ごめんヴァレン、よくわかんねーわ…たぶん寝てたと思うけど、寝てる自分が自分で寝てるなってどうしたらわかるんだ？それにあの日だろ？あの後、どうしたんだっけ…」\r\n　「ちょ、ちょっと落ち着きなよ。意味わからないこと言ってるよ。」\r\n　彼があまり記憶力の良い方ではないことも、そもそも行動にほとんど意味を持たせないことも知っている。だから本当は、見かけたあのときに声をかければ良かったのだろうけど。驚きのあまり―憤りや悲しさも混じって―行動に移すまで考えが回らなかった。間接的な連絡手段という手もあったが、内容が内容なのではぐらかされないか心配であったし、できればこうして姉さんにはすぐに聞かせないような機会をうかがっていたら、日が過ぎてしまった。\r\n　「ほら、茶髪で巻き毛の女の子とか、後ろをちょこっと縛った男性に心当たりないの？」\r\n　「えー…知らねーぞ…？…つか待て、え、男…？」\r\n　僕はこくりと頷く。\r\n　「いや、別に…そういうの趣味だって聞いても引かないからさ、正直に話してよ。」\r\n　「い、いみわかりません…」\r\n　「君女装してその人と会っていたでしょ？」\r\n　彼は持ち上げたコップを、そのことを忘れたように落とすが、それが平たい板に打ち付けられる前に反対の手で受け止める。\r\n　「はあ？！なんだよ、それ…」\r\n　「わけわからなかったのは僕の方だよ！」\r\n　しん…とあたりが静まる。店には他にも客はいたけれど、僕の出した大声で周りの人々はこちらを黙って見つめてしまったためであった。こほんとひとつ咳払いをし、何でもないように装うとやがて興味を失った見物人は各々の会話へと戻っていった。\r\n　「…本当に、俺は何も知らねーぞ…？」\r\n　ナセルはその白い瞳を伏せると黙したまま席を立ち、帰って行ってしまった。それがただ理不尽な証言への怒りに気分を悪くしただけなら人違いなのだろう。僕には、どちらとも判別がつかなかった。\r\n　\r\n　翌朝、昨日の喧嘩で沈んだままの気分を引きずりながら、そんな空気を吹き飛ばすためもかねて散歩へと出かけた。長年つきあいがありながら、他人とはこうもわからないものなのであろうか。彼は嘘をつくとか、そういう曲がったことが嫌いというか苦手というか…平気でするような人間ではないと思っていたのに。\r\n　前方に花を扱っている店が見えた。店先に旬のものが店内へ誘うようにハの字に並んで、僕はそれを膝に手をついて眺めてみた。色とりどりの花や草が、それでも秩序を持ってそよ風に揺れている。と、\r\n　「いちいち関わってくるな！」\r\n　罵声に驚いて顔を上げる。店の入り口から青年と少女が飛び出し、内部から反論の声が発される。2人は不機嫌顔を道へ向けるとそのまま足早に去って行ってしまう。それが\"赤の他人\"であればただ呆れるばかりで、店内の人の愚痴でも聞いたのだろうが。\r\n　僕は駆けていった。白髪の青年と、緩くまとめた茶髪の少女。紛れもなく彼らはあの日、あの通りで見かけた彼らであったのだ。\r\n　追いかけていって、言葉じゃ届かないかもしれないと彼らの前に立ちはだかるように、しっかりと体を支えるように足を広げた。\r\n　「……？」\r\n　僕が息を整えている間に彼らは立ち止まって、何だろうと言わんばかりに顔を見合わせる。少女が声をあげた。\r\n　「あのー…何か用？」\r\n　キッとナセルを睨む。彼は涼しそうに、つまらなさそうに見つめ返していた。\r\n　「…もう、言い逃れはできないよね？」\r\n　そんな彼の態度に腹が立って、つい声に怒りが漏れる。少女の方が不快な顔をして、彼に知り合いかと尋ねていた。\r\n　「…さあね、どうでもいいじゃん。行こ。」\r\n　「なっ……」\r\n　どうでもいいだって？\r\n　顔を背けて歩みを進めようとするナセルの腕を掴み、彼らのつないでいた手を引きはがす。そうしてようやく彼は、僕へと敵意を向けた。\r\n　「…はじめまして。」\r\n　僕はぱっと彼の腕を放すと、少女へ向き直り軽くお辞儀をしてみせる。予想していなかったのだろう、きょとんと目を丸め、離された腕を反対の手で覆う。\r\n　「僕は彼の…恋人の弟です。」\r\n　「はあ？」\r\n　後ろにトゲのある声が聞こえた。一方の少女は、首をかしげて的外れな悩みをつぶやいていた。\r\n　「えーと…私、ひとりっ子だよ？」\r\n　がくりと足を踏み外してしまいそうだ。わざとなのか本気なのかは知らないが、ひとまずそうではないと首を振って回りくどい言い方はやめにした。\r\n　「ですから、あなた以外に彼には恋人がいるって事ですよっ」\r\n　「…えぇ？！」\r\n　少女は一瞬間をあけ驚くと、僕の後ろへ見える彼へと視線を向け、僕もそれを追いかけた。彼は頭をかいてため息をつく。しかし焦りはうかがえなかった。\r\n　「…で、おまえの目的は？」\r\n　「え？」\r\n　聞き返すと彼はだから、と説明を加える。\r\n　「そんな嘘で得たいものは何だ？ただの好奇心か、それともそいつか…」\r\n　「…本気で言ってるの？」\r\n　彼は当たり前のように頷き、納得したように少女もぽんと手をたたいた。どうやら彼らは、僕がいたずらに道行く人への迷惑行為をしている少年か、彼女の追っかけのどちらかだと決めつけてしまったらしい。\r\n　「…どうしてだよ、ナセル。」\r\n　どうして？あのときだって姉さんと仲良く話し始めたじゃないか。用事とか適当なこと言って別の人間と過ごしているなんて…僕は呆れやら悲しみやらで項垂れた。\r\n　「…『ナセル』？おい、なんだよそりゃ…」\r\n　彼の声に顔を上げる。彼と彼女とを交互に見つめ、その不思議そうな表情に、背を汗が流れたのを感じる。どうして、は僕の方だ。その可能性を受け入れなかった。それは彼の容姿がひどく珍しいためであろう。\r\n\r\n　「ごめんなさい！」\r\n　これでもかと腰を曲げ、僕は全力で謝った。\r\n　「なーんか、変だと思った。話がかみ合ってないみたいにさ。」\r\n　少女、カルーンは納得がいくとナセルにそっくりな青年、ハウェアの隣へと並ぶ。僕はもう一度顔を上げ、申し訳なくて恥ずかしくて俯く。\r\n　「…そんなに似てるのかねぇ……」\r\n　ハウェアは幾分か人違いに気分を悪くしているようであったが、少女の方は温厚なのか少し驚くだけで声音から怒りはうかがえない。\r\n　「それは、もう…近くで見たって、違いが判らないくらい。そりゃ、比べれば違うんでしょうけど…」\r\n　違うかな、と思うところは演技でまかなえるようなものばかり。髪の色、目の色、声音―ただしこれはハウェアの方が乱暴な調子を含んでいる―、背格好…何から何までが同じに見えてしまう。\r\n　「じゃ、一件落着ってことで…ハウェアも沸点低いけど、あなたも気を付けてね。ばいばーい。」\r\n　言ってカルーンはハウェアを引っ張っていった。僕はもう一度お辞儀をして、そんな彼らを見送った。\r\n　\r\n　穏やかな日差しにあくびをして、郵便受けを確認する。配達物は特になし。情報誌や広告の類いも特には入っていなかった。というのも、僕の家は街から少し外れにあって、別段生活がかかっているわけでもない彼らがそこまで赴く必要もないためである。\r\n　見渡せば街へと続く一本道の周りの草原で草花が揺れていた。\r\n　「もし。」\r\n　そんなのどかな風景にふさわしい気高くも優しい声がかけられた。振り返ると、少女とおぼしき2人の人影があった。\r\n　「はい…？」\r\n　ブロンドの巻き髪を両サイドにまとめている少女の方が日傘を傾けてにこりと顔を見せた。\r\n　「ここらでクワルを見かけませんでした？首にカイのプレートをつけていて…」\r\n　「クワル、ですか…？」\r\n　プレートの有無を考慮しないにしても、クワルなどと珍しいものをみつけたらちょっとした騒ぎになる。けれどもそんな噂は聞かないし…\r\n　「いえ、知りませんけど。」\r\n　それにしても物好きな子だ。見た目からも\"お嬢様\"をにおわせるが、何かしらの分野で名のある者なのだろうか。なんとなく、クワルやそれに類するものにはそんなイメージがある。\r\n　「もう、あの子ったら一体どこへ行ってしまったのかしら…」\r\n　少女は少し頬を膨らませて街を向く。すると彼女の後方から、さきほどまで目立たないよう控えていた付き人らしき少女が声を上げた。\r\n　「あ…あの、ラック・ローズさま…」\r\n　ハンチングを目深に被り、ささやくような小声であった。\r\n　「ん？どうかした？」\r\n　「やはり、お屋敷の方ではないでしょうか…きっと噂になってしまいます。」\r\n　それもそうね、と日傘の少女は納得したように頷いていたが、僕としては理解できる状況ではなかった。\r\n　―だってその声は…\r\n　そっと、顔を覗くため膝を曲げる。帽子の唾から短い白髪とまっ白な瞳が「ラック・ローズ」と呼ばれた少女へ向けられている。\r\n　僕は思わず手を伸ばし、その帽子へ触れるとつまみ上げて取り去った。驚いた彼女たちは目を丸くしたが、すぐに強気な叫びが突きつけられた。\r\n　「何するのよあなた！」\r\n　手のひらの帽子をラックが取り返す。彼女はすぐにもう1人へ帽子を戻すと、かばうように自分の体を僕とその子の間へと入れた。彼は後ろで震えていた。\r\n　「……どういうこと？」\r\n　「それはこっちの台詞です。いきなり見ず知らずの人から物をとるなんて…」\r\n　「見ず知らず…ではないんです。僕は彼を…知っている。」\r\n　「え…」\r\n　短く疑問の声を上げたのはラックではなかった。\r\n　「そうだよね。」\r\n　「し、知りません…わたしは…」\r\n　はあ、とラックがため息をつく。\r\n　「相手しなくて良いわよ、ロトルア。あなた何ですの？この子は渡しませんわ。」\r\n　「ふざけないでよ、ナセル…」\r\n　それまでは僕を誰かの仇のように鋭い目つきでにらみつけていたラックだったが、何かに気づいたようにはっとすると1人頷き、怯えるような彼へ待っているよう告げて、僕の腕を引っ張って家の側面へと回り込んだ。\r\n　少女はぱっとスカートの汚れを払うような仕草をして、\r\n　「ごめんなさい、私ったらてっきり口説いているのかと…\"タナ\"さんですよね？初めまして、ラック・ローズと申します。お話はカルーンさんから伺っておりますわ。」\r\n　「わ、ち、違います…タナは僕の姉です。」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　え、と驚きを示したいのはこちらの方だ。明らかにモノ探しに来ただけの少女から、まさか姉の名が出ようとは…\r\n　ラックはしばらく黙り込んだが、やがて先ほどの敵意も謝った時のようなうれしそうな顔もなくなった、微妙な表情となった。\r\n　「…無関係者？弟さんは、知らない…？」\r\n　「何のことですか…」\r\n　「確かに、知っているにしてはおかしな物言いでしたけど…」\r\n　聞き返したことにも気づかずに、ラックは自らの思考を続ける。僕には彼女のつぶやきがまるで理解できなかった。彼女の言葉に出てくる単語はどれも理解できるのに、それらが一つの文へと形を成すとわからなくなる。最も重要な情報がぬけているのだろう。\r\n　「あ、あの…どういうことか教えてくれませんか？」\r\n　少し声を張り、もう一度声をかける。彼女ははっとしてこちらへと向き直るとただ静かに首を振った。大鳥のように優雅に、演技なのかはさておき変わらずの不安そうな表情の彼の元へと歩き戻っていった。\r\n　「行きますわよ、ロトルア。」\r\n　「はい。」\r\n　待ってくれと、教えて欲しいと改めて頼んだものの、ラックが一瞬だけこちらへお辞儀しただけで、彼女たちは去って行ってしまった。\r\n　怒りにも悲しみにも空しさにも、呆れにさえならないもやもやした感情を持て余して、ひとつため息をついた。\r\n　\r\n　すっきりと解決したはずの事柄に、再び靄がかかった。他人は他人、関係がないといえばまあ、それまでなのだが両親を早くに亡くしたために生活の知恵を与えてくれた姉は僕にとっては大切な人なのだ。無駄な心配も悲しみもできうる限りは避けたい。…いや、そんな綺麗な事ではなく、親友…と思っていた人物の謎多き言動。裏切られたと認めたくなくての探索なのかもしれない。\r\n　寂れた道へ向かっていった影をみつけて後へついて行ってみれば、そこは行ったこともないような場所で、すぐ近くにこのような並木道があったのかと本来の目的を忘れそうになる。\r\n　怪しまれないように、かといって顔がばれないように距離を置いて帽子をかぶり、のそのそと歩みを進める。彼は周りを気にした風もなくまっすぐに道をたどっていく。前方から通行人が現れても、それが、以前に会っていた「彼」であっても。\r\n　「って、えぇ？！」\r\n　思わず声に出た驚きをふさごうと口に手を伸ばす。不審な動きにこちらへ視線を向けたのはその、喫茶店から見てしまった、ナセルがフリルを身につけていた時一緒にいた男であった。彼の方も、奇声を上げた僕へ侮蔑の視線を向けることはあっても、ナセルへ興味を示す事はなかった。何か、別の利益があっての関係だったのだろうか。\r\n　やがてナセルは一つの家の前で立ち止まると、扉をノックした。僕は慌ててすぐ近くの木の後ろへ背を預けた。\r\n　少しの間の後に現れたのは紫髪を短めに切りそろえた少女で、カルーンでもラックでもなかった。\r\n　また、新しい人か―\r\n　自然とため息が漏れる。重心を傾けてそちらへ足を伸ばしたが、彼らはすぐに家の中へと入っていってしまった。さすがに\"彼女\"の家へと押し入るわけにも行かずに半端な位置で突っ立ってしまう。\r\n　「何してるの？」\r\n　声に振り向くとカルーンがいた。かい物帰りなのだろうか、手提げの籠には材料袋が詰め込まれている。\r\n　「いや、なんというか…」\r\n　「元気ないね。あ、そうだ…」\r\n　言うと彼女は僕が来た道へと2，3歩進み手招きする。\r\n　「店に寄ってかない？ちょうど材料仕入れたし…」\r\n　「店をやっていたんですか。」\r\n　「うん。誰かと話すの好きなのよ私。」\r\n　カルーンは手元の端末のカバーを開くと何が良いかと質問する。とりあえずドンサトを、と頼めばすぐに彼女はスイッチを押した。厨房の方から機械独特の動作音がする。\r\n　「ハウェアともこの店の前で会ったんだ－。」\r\n　え？と聞き返せばこの間一緒に歩いていた彼だと説明される。別に誰かという意味で聞き返したわけではないのだが…彼のことは、忘れようとしてもしばらくは無理であろう。\r\n　「彼ね、あんな怒りっぽいけど結構臆病なんだよ？」\r\n　「はぁ…」\r\n　「それとね、ここみたいな調理機の味が好きなんだ。」\r\n　「そうですか…て、え？」\r\n　どうかしのかと首をかしげた彼女であったが、調理終了音が部屋に鳴り響くと、立ち上がった。はじめはなぜそのような惚気を聞かされなければならないのかと疑問であったが、それよりも彼女の言葉が気になった。たしかナセルは…\r\n　少し前から姉さんが材料袋を使わない、素材を加工する類いの料理を始めた。少しして彼に振る舞ったことがあったが、そのとき彼は確かにいつも食べてるものより遙かにうまいと笑顔を見せていた。\r\n　カルーンが料理を運んできた。片手には僕が頼んだドンサト、反対の手にはガンブが湯気を立てている。彼女も食事をするのだろう。\r\n　「カルーンさん。」\r\n　「なあに？」\r\n　「あのときは納得したんですけど、あれから色々あって…やっぱり僕は、人違いではなかったと思うんです。」\r\n　照明の具合も、空模様も何も変化はなかったけれど、ふっと辺りが暗くなったかのように思えた。さきほどとは打って変わってカルーンは真面目な顔つきになる。\r\n　「…それは、ナセルさんのこと？」\r\n　「ええ。ハウェアのことです。」\r\n　彼女はため息をついて視線をそらす。\r\n　「ちょっとだけ期待したんだよね、本当は。ちょっとだけだよ？…もしかしたら、知っている人なのかなーって。でも君は、『彼』の知り合いじゃなかった。」\r\n　「どういうことです？」\r\n　「ごめんね、関係者以外には言わないことにしているの。」\r\n　―関係者？\r\n　「あの、それは」\r\n　「だーいじょうぶ。…たしか、お姉さんが心配だったんだよね？安心してよ、君の心配しているようなことは何もないから。」\r\n　それ以上のことは、うまいこと話をそらされてのせられて聞き出すことができなかった。店には人が集まりだし、長居するのも失礼かと、そろそろ帰らなければという時間となってしまい今日のところは諦めるしかないようだ。\r\n　カルーンさんは、帰り際にもう一度大丈夫だよ、と念を押した。\r\n\r\n　\"世の中には似た人が3人はいる\"、との言葉は聞いたことがあった。\r\n　けれども僕が出会ったのは少なくとも4人で、さらには世界どころかここら周辺にいるようなのだ。ここ最近のことだから、一部は以前から住んでいるというより遊びに来たか、近頃越してきたか…そもそも、彼の場合は同じ色合いを見つけるだけでも苦労しそうなのに、本当にそんな\"何もない\"ことが実現できるのだろうか。\r\n　そんな屁理屈のような皮肉のようなことをぼーっと考えながら時間を確認する。\r\n　小さな林に隣接した公園。子供さえ遊んでいないこんなところでやることはといえば、人を待つこと。1ラクほど前にナセルと、今日隣町で行われるイベントへ遊びに行こうと約束していた。そのときはまさかこんな感情にさいなまされるとも知らずに二つ返事で了承してしまったのだが、今回ばかりは心のどこかで彼が約束を忘れていたらいいのにと願ってしまう。\r\n　時刻は約束の少し前を示していた。頂上へと向かう日がいつもよりまぶしく感じる。その明るさがなんだか憎たらしくて、たまには僕の方が約束を破っても良いのではないかとの考えが浮かぶ。彼も待たされる怒りを思い知るべきだ、と。\r\n　少し悩みはしたが、そうと決めるとそのまま丘へと向かった。\r\n　日常なら家族づれやら何やらで賑わっている草原だが、隣町でのイベントは、なかなか評判が良く多くの者が楽しみにしていることで、今日は丘の頂上を挟んで生える大きな二本木もどこか寂しげだった。\r\n　一本の強い風が吹き抜けていく。風下へと視線を移す。遠く―そちらは確か崖となっている―に人影が見えた。\r\n　「な…」\r\n　こんな日に、こんな昼前の明るいときに何をするつもりだろう。僕は足早にそちらへと向かう。幻などではなく、その崖のすぐ側には人が立っていた。\r\n　その人は遠く空を見上げていたが、足音に気づいたのかこちらへと振りかえった。\r\n\r\n　たとえばこの草原が黄金に変わって、僕の意思を、その子の髪を靡かせる風がさらって行ってしまったような、虚無の恐怖のようでしかし無限を体感しているような心地の良い感覚にとらわれる。\r\n\r\n　僕は、その子の無知な微笑みに心奪われていたのだ。\r\n\r\n　それがそのような感情を抱くべき相手でないと気づいたのは、その人が笑顔を解いて不思議そうにこちらを見つめた時であった。\r\n　「…って、ナセル？！」\r\n　大声に驚くようにびくりと体を震わせる。そんな彼に近づいて肩をたたいた。\r\n　「もう、こんなところで何してるのさっ…」\r\n　そこまで言って急に罪悪感に襲われる。彼はしばらく黙っていたが、肩に置かれた僕の手にそっと触れてどかすように誘う。\r\n　「…セントクレア。」\r\n　透き通るような、か弱く優しい声だった。\r\n　声質というか、根本的な音はナセルのものであったのに、最終的な音の出し方は彼のそれではない。\r\n　彼の手が頬を包むように触れられた。そんな声色や雰囲気には似合わぬ、しっかりした手であった。\r\n　「なせるジャナイ…セントクレア。」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　喋ることになれていないのか、カタコトにそう告げると、再び手を下ろして微笑んだ。\r\n　「セントクレア…ヴァレンスキ…」\r\n　「はい…？」\r\n　「キノシた…ネムッテタ…ヴァレンガ、オコシてクレタ…」\r\n　キノシた―？木の下…？\r\n　出会ったときのことであろうか。少し時間が欲しい。突然すぎて頭を整理したい。\r\n　「ええと…『セントクレア』？それは一体…」\r\n　しかし彼はそれには答えずにまっすぐにこちらを見つめていた。\r\n　いや、僕の後ろを見つめていたらしい。そのことに気づいて振り向ききるよりはやく聞き覚えのある声が聞こえた。\r\n　「あらあら、こんなところにいたのね。」\r\n　「もしかして、新しい子かな？」\r\n　「どうりで、誰とも一緒じゃなかったはずだ…」\r\n　「ふふ、仕方のないことですわ。ねえ？」\r\n　「え、うん…」\r\n　複数人の集団が、覗くように二本木の影から現れる。彼も彼女も、僕はそれぞれに知っていたけれど、彼らが集っている事への説明は思いつかなかった。\r\n　「姉さん…？！それに、カルーンさんも…」\r\n　右の腕に何かが触れたことも気にせずに、丘の頂上の辺りへと戻り、順に顔を見回してもう一度首をかしげると、二度ほど見かけた男性が疑問の声を上げた。\r\n　「知り合いか？」\r\n　「ええ。紹介しますね、私の弟のヴァレン。」\r\n　姉さんがこちらへ手のひらを地面と水平になるように向け、反射的にお辞儀をした。僕だけが一方的に見たことのある2人―疑問を投げかけた男と並木道の家の紫髪の少女―もお辞儀を返した。\r\n　顔を上げたところで、腕の違和感に気がつく。\r\n　「うわぁ？！」\r\n　思いきり振り払うように退くと、彼は手を離してくれた。ナセルが、僕の腕へと抱きついていたのだ。驚くなという方が無理である。寒気さえしていた。というのに、\r\n　「…ヴァレン、そういう態度はひどいんじゃないの？」\r\n　「え、ええ…？」\r\n　そう諭したのは姉さんだ。確かに彼も離された手を淋しそうにお互いで包んでうつむいているようであったが、怒りの矛先が間違っているのではないだろうか。\r\n　「だって…ナセル、だよね？」\r\n　確認するように、自らを落ち着かせるようにつぶやいた言葉に、その場にいた皆が首を振った。そうして彼を―彼は自分を―指さすと、声をそろえて、\r\n　「「セントクレア。」」\r\n　と僕へと告げた。\r\n　そうしてまた彼が腕へとくっつくのだが、それをどうこう言う者は誰一人いなかった。ここにいる誰もが、彼とはそういう関係だと思っていたのだが、まさかまた、別人だと言い張るのだろうか。\r\n　「あの、皆さんはどういうお知り合いなんですか？」\r\n　「どういうって…まあ、成り行き？」\r\n　「難しいですよね、\"今\"説明するのは…」\r\n　穏やかになった風が木の葉を揺らす。側のセントクレア(？)の髪は、彼と同じく短かったのに、川が流れるように遠くまで伸びているのではと感じてしまう。続けられない言葉を待つ間に改めて見つめてしまっていた。と。\r\n　「きゃあ！！」\r\n　突然彼…女が僕を突き放した。あまりに突然だったから受け身もとれずに草の中へと突っ伏してしまう。何をするのだと起き上がれば、ラック・ローズが彼女をなだめていた。\r\n　「ラックさま…変な人が…」\r\n　「よしよし、大丈夫よ。」\r\n　先程までの、喋り慣れていないようなカタコトさは何処へやら、儚い雰囲気と共に隠れて、彼女は臆病な少女のようであった。\r\n　「…あ、ちょうどいいんじゃない？」\r\n　僕の混乱を察したのか、カルーンがラックへ、彼女を落ち着かせるために少し離れたところにいてはどうかと提案する。どうやら、彼女がいるところでの説明は難しいという意味だったらしい。\r\n　「ええ、勿論です。ほら、行きましょう？」\r\n　「はい…」\r\n　彼女らは崖の近く、危険でないところまで仲良く歩いて行った。そんな後ろ姿を見送って、さて、と切り出したのはカルーンだ。\r\n　「ご覧のように、今は\"ロトルア\"なの。」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　―ロトルア。確か以前、ラックと共にいた彼がそう呼ばれていた。\r\n　僕はそのことを思い出し、彼女の恐れるような仕草には納得することができた。が、つい先程まではセントクレアだと言っていなかったか…？\r\n　「『ロトルア』ちゃんはラックさんの恋人なのよ。女の子同士だけどね。」\r\n　姉さんが微笑みながら続け、男がどこかを見つめて付け加える。\r\n　「性別なんて、他人には関係ないだろ。」\r\n　―いや、そうではない。\r\n　たしかにそこへの疑問も尽きないのだが、今はとにかくそうではないのだ。\r\n　さらに、理解の追いつかない僕へ追い打ちをかけるかのように、カルーンが得意げに説明する。\r\n　「私の彼やタナさんの恋人は会ったことあるよね？ハウェアにナセル、それでこちらの、マナグアさんの恋人が「ノイジードル」、ガトゥンさんの彼女は「ワカティプ」っていうのよ。」\r\n　彼女は順に、自分、姉さん、紫髪の少女、男と指し示していく。\r\n　「ん…？」\r\n　「だから言ったでしょ？あなたが心配するようなことは何もないの。」\r\n　彼女は最後に僕を指さすと仕方のない…と言わんばかりに胸を張った。\r\n　やはり、同一人物だとの認識であっているのだろうか。\r\n　「呼び方を変えている…ってことですか？」\r\n　「えぇ…？」\r\n　呆れるような不審に思っているような視線が集まったのは一瞬のことで、彼らは僕の欠けている前提とでも言うべき条件をすぐに察した。\r\n　「あ、だからね、あの子は多重人格者なの。」\r\n\r\n　僕は二度瞬きをして、自分の中の辞書をたどる。そうして見つけたその意味と、今までとを照らし合わせ、ようやく現実を理解できたのだ。\r\n　意味のわからなかったことが明確になった瞬間というものは、一種の快感を持っている。\r\n　「…て、え？！ナセルが？！」\r\n　「そりゃそうか、わかんないよね。」\r\n　「私も聞くまで疑ってましたし…」\r\n　「ああ、タナさんは本当にすごいよな。」\r\n　彼らが言うには、はじめにそのことに気づいたのは姉さんだという。「ナセル」を始めとする彼ら自身でさえ認識していないことであった。そうであったのに、彼女は嘘と決めつけずにカルーンさんやガトゥンさんと話し合って事実を突き詰めたそうだ。それからは新しくできた恋人へも説明し、今の奇妙な関係ができあがっていった。\r\n　はじめてラックと会った時に、彼女が\"カルーンから聞いている\"といったのはそのことだったのだろう。\r\n　「皆それぞれ知り合いでもなかったけれど、いい人達できちんとわかってくれたのよ。」\r\n　「ま、それぞれあの子が気に入ったんだから、些細な事よね。」\r\n　彼らは彼…ナセルやらセントクレアやらをまとめて呼ぶ時は「ラーセ」という言葉を使っているそうだ。たしか、古い言葉で「総称」を意味する語だと昔姉さんが教えてくれた気がする。その「ラーセ」は誰も自分以外を知らない。先程理不尽に「ロトルア」から突き飛ばされたのも、そういうことだったのか…\r\n　「…いやいや、どうしてそんな簡単に受け入れられるのさ！だって\"見かけ\"は同一人物なんだよね？！」\r\n　出かけに行く程度ならさほどの問題はないだろう。けれども…例えば結婚するだとか、もっと深い関係となった時に、「別の人格だから」で妥協できるものなのだろうか。\r\n　「え…できないの？」\r\n　しかしその問いにはきょとんと目を丸められる。―あるいは、そこまでは考えていないのだろうか。それとも僕が変なところにこだわりすぎているだけなのだろうか。彼らの団結力はそう錯覚させるほど強く、\"妥協\"という言葉さえ似合ってはくれなかった。\r\n　頭を冷やそうと遠くへ顔を向ける。が、冷えるどころかまさに今心配していたようなことが行われており、パニックで不自然に立ちはだかったため、彼らもその光景を目の当たりにした。\r\n　「あらあら。」\r\n　「全く、いくら人目がないからって、相変わらず積極的なやつだな。」\r\n　「あはは、ラックさんはまっすぐだよね。」\r\n　「わあ…」\r\n　…が、反応はこの通りである。マナグアに至っては、彼女の方が恥ずかしがってしまう始末。怒りとか嫉妬とか、彼らにはないのだろうか。\r\n　「あの…自分の恋人にキス…されているんですよ？」\r\n　「え？ロトルアだよ？」\r\n　「だいたいそれがなんだって言うんだ？」\r\n　話が通じない。\r\n　僕はなんだか疲れて、諦めてそれ以上そのことについては触れないでおこうと一人思う。\r\n　「それよりヴァレン、どうするの？セントクレアちゃんのこと。」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　いきなり何のことやら、と姉さんへと向く。\r\n　「ほら、あの子はどうみてもお前に気があっただろ？きちんと応えてやれよ。」\r\n　「ま、嫌だっていうのも伝えないとわからないからねー。」\r\n　ああそういえば、というのが素直な感想だった。とはいえそういうことに慣れているわけでも、彼…女に全く興味がないわけでもない。\r\n　ただ少し、事情が複雑だったのだ。\r\n　僕にとっては長い間ただ彼であったのだから。\r\n　明確に答えも出せずに考え込んでいると、ラック達が戻ってきて話へ加わった。\r\n　「まあ、すぐにどうこうする必要はないんじゃないかしら。次いつ会えるのかもわかりませんし…」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　一周頭を回してからその答えにたどり着く。ロトルアは話について行けずに相づちとしては不自然に首を動かすのだが、ラックを信頼しているのか深く関わろうとはしなかった。\r\n　「…あ、そっか、そうなるのか。」\r\n　カルーンがちょいと手招きするので耳を貸すと補足してくれた。\r\n　「…だからね、時間を指定するような約束事も禁止。したいのにできなくて、ストレスになっちゃうことあるから。…まあ、気にしない人もいるみたいだけどね。」\r\n　ぱっとある人物のことが思い当たる。口先だけは謝っても、何の対処も解決も考えようとせずに笑っている。\r\n　―そうか、彼がよく約束を破っていたのは。ある時から、姉さんが注意しなくなったのは。\r\n　僕が頷けば、周りの皆はにこりと笑った。\r\n　「そうだ。これからみんなで、隣町で行われている《ショヤン》に行きませんか。」\r\n　彼らはとても仲が良い。友人グループ…というよりは、結婚相手を含んだ親族のような関係なのだろう。\r\n　反対する者は誰一人いなかった。もちろん「彼女」も。\r\n　僕もこの奇妙な関係に加わるのかと思うと、嬉しいような、悲しいような…`\r\n","export

`　暖かな朝日が差し込む少し前の暁、布団の上で彼が動いた。ごそごそと覆い被さっていた掛け布団を腕でどけ、薄目に天井を見上げる。しばらくはそうして回らない頭で模様を数えていたが、ふと見た窓に、彼は驚愕した。勢いよく起き上がると、今見たものは現実なのか、ただの虚像だったのかと手のひらを頭の後ろに当てて確認する。前者だ。\r\n　まだ首もとであるのにとげとげと髪が刺さってくる。耳より前の髪だけが胸まで伸びていて…いつ、髪を切ったのだろうか。\r\n　彼は布団から降りると薄闇に反射する己の姿をもう一度見ると、体にも異常があることがわかってクローゼットをあける。しかし現状が変わることはなく…たまらなくなって外へ飛び出した。\r\n　朝日が顔を出せば、上るまでにさほど時間はかからない。彼は失敗したな、と爽やかな通りを俯いて歩いていた。服装も、簡素で自分の好みとはかけ離れている。というか、これは配られるような一般的なものだ。ため息をついて、足取りは服屋へ向かっていた。\r\n　そのような早朝ではあったが、店にはいくらか人がいた。もともと人気のブランド。いつ誰がいてもそこまでおかしいことではないが、今回ばかりは膨れてしまう。扉からちょこっと覗いて、こっそりと素早く服を手にして試着室へ駆け込んだ。まじまじと選びはしなかったが、さすがというべきか、適当にとってもそれなりにかわいい服であった。彼は機嫌を取り戻すとそれを着、他にもいくつか気に入ったものを貰っていく。これくらいかなと出入り口へ向かったとき、後ろから声をかけられた。\r\n　「こんにちは。」\r\n　振り向けば背の高い女性が見下ろしていた。\r\n　「はい、何でしょう。」\r\n　「ふふ、瞳も綺麗なのね。」\r\n　彼は首をかしげ、それで用事はとやや不機嫌に答える。\r\n　「ねえ、家に来ない？私、服を作ったりしてるんだけど…いろんなのを着せてあげるわ。この辺じゃ珍しいのよ。あなたみたいに女装のかわいい子。」\r\n　「は…？」\r\n　自分でも少し失礼かなと思う嫌悪と疑問を含んだ声が漏れた。けれども相手は気にしていないように彼の手をとると怪しく微笑んだ。その欲に染まった視線が怖くて彼は動けなかった。と、\r\n　「おい、人の連れに手、出してんじゃねーぞ。」\r\n　彼女の後ろから、同じかもう少し高めの影が現れ、彼に伸ばされた手を引き剥がし睨み付ける。\r\n　「…っち。」\r\n　彼女は男に捕まれた腕を振りほどきそそくさと扉から出ていった。ぼーっとその様を青年は見つめていたが、我に返ると彼も出入り口へ向かう。あ、おい。と先程の男が声をかけるが、彼は振り向かなかった。\r\n　このご時世、我が身を守るのは当たり前のことで、善意で助けるなどということはまずあり得なかった。そのうらにはほぼ確実に何らかの欲望が潜んでいる。その欲望に大小、種類は多々あれど、関わらないに越したことはない。\r\n　「な、なあ…待てって。」\r\n　随分しつこいものだなと彼は視線だけで男の顔を振り替える。\r\n　「先程助けていただいたことには感謝しています。けど、もうついてこないでください。」\r\n　「けどっ…」\r\n　ただでさえ朝のことで気分はよくなかった。その上不快な指摘、加えてこれである。男は追うばかりでこれといった提案をしてこないし…青年は我慢の限度を悟るとくるりと振り向いて声をあげた。\r\n　「なんなんですか、一体。」\r\n　「何ってほら、これ…」\r\n　彼は軽く手を腰まであげる。そこには紙袋がかかっており、それには先程の店のロゴが描かれている。\r\n　「あ…」\r\n　そう、先程腕を捕まれたときに、反対の手に持ってはいたけれど、驚いて落としてしまっていたのだろう。青年は無言で受けとると、恥ずかしそうに俯いた。\r\n　「…大事なものだろ？」\r\n　「え…」\r\n　「だって、君みたいにおしゃれな子が、こんなに一度に持ってくってのはそれなりの事情があると思うから。」\r\n　顔をあげると、男は青年とは別の意味で照れたように目を背けていた。\r\n　「あの…これだけですか？」\r\n　「え？…もしかして、まだ他にも持ってた？」\r\n　男はあたふたと、今から戻るべきかと悩み始める。その慌てたような表情に青年は思わず笑みが漏れた。\r\n　「いいえ、違いますよ。…あなたの用事はこれを届けてくださることだけですか？っていう意味です。」\r\n　「えーと…」と男は頭をかいて、あ、と思い付いたように公園でのおしゃべりへ誘った。\r\n　「私てっきり、先程の人と変わらないのかと思ってました。」\r\n　「あはは…ま、ふつーそうだよな。」\r\n　近くのスポットで男―ガトゥンはダクを汲んでくると青年へ渡す。自分も別のそれを喉に流しながら少し間を開けて隣へ座った。\r\n　「それ…舞台でもやってるのか？」\r\n　「え…？…いいえ、自分のです。…よくわからないけど、突然家にあった服が全て配布されるものへ変わってしまっていて…」\r\n　「なっ？そんなことあるのか？」\r\n　青年はこくりと頷く。その顔は哀しさが漂っている。\r\n　「あの…私、」\r\n　彼はガトゥンへぐいと迫る。彼は驚いたがその真剣な表情に押されて顔を背けることができなかった。\r\n　「私、やっぱり男なんですかね…」\r\n　「へ…？」\r\n　彼は見上げていた視線を戻すと、元のように座り直し続ける。\r\n　「よく言われるんです。どうして女装するのって。…心外です。私はそんなつもり、ないのに…」\r\n　ガトゥンはまじまじと彼を見つめた。確かに中性的な顔をしており、かわいらしい服を着ていると遠目女性にうつるだろう。しかしこうして近くで見るとなかなかいい骨格をしているのか、彼が女性であると間違えることはない。\r\n　「んと…まあ、生物的には？」\r\n　「そうですよね…」\r\n　ふう、と彼はため息をつく。\r\n　「…本当は、他人にどう言われようが関係ない…」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　「わかってはいるんです。性別なんてせいぜい体力差が平均的に変わる程度…結局は当人の問題で、他人には関係ない…」\r\n　ぽつぽつと暗唱するように、静かに呟く彼をガトゥンは見守る。いや、彼の方が聞きたかったのかもしれない。\r\n　「わかってはいるけど…やっぱり、言われると辛い…自分が否定されるみたいで…何の関わりもないような他人に。」\r\n　彼の瞳は、見上げた空を映しはしなかった。真っ白で何色にも染まってしまいそうで、何よりも強い光の色だった。\r\n　「なあ、ワカティプ…」\r\n　「はい。」\r\n　「もし俺が、俺は見た目通りに男じゃないって言っても、かといって女って訳でもないと思ってるっていったら、あんたはなんて思う？」\r\n　「…そうですか。」\r\n　彼は…彼女は素っ気なく優しく微笑んだ。\r\n　「…いるんだよな、一定数は、俺みたいな奴。どっちでもなくって、けど、どっちでもあるような気がして…友人にも笑われたよ。ネタにされてる。」\r\n　こくりと彼女は頷く。\r\n　「これでいいのかな。」\r\n　「いいと思いますよ。今でもそう思えるなら。…気が変わったら、それはそれでいいと思いますし。」\r\n　「…そうだな。ちょっと、考えすぎてたかも。」\r\n　ガトゥンは、彼女を助けたのは失礼だったかなと反省した。他人を助けるのなんて柄じゃなくて、どうしてそんなことをしたのか、彼にもわからなかった。けれども彼女と話してわかったのだ。俺は彼女に、自分の問題を押し付けていたのだと。\r\n　\r\n　友人は、そこまで多い方ではなかった。年齢があがると色恋話が増えて、彼はそれに混ざれなかったのだ。\r\n　からり、と安っぽい鐘の音が来客を知らせると奥からマスターの声が迎えた。ガトゥンは腐れ縁とも呼べる友人と飲みにきたのだった。頻繁に来るわけではないが、数年ぶりというわけでもない。彼らは空いているテーブル席に座ると注文をした。\r\n　「…おまえさ、なんかぼーっとしてね？」\r\n　「え？」\r\n　今の話も聞いてなかっただろと友人の青年は笑って手を広げる。その手をぽんと叩いてあ、と言葉を続けた。\r\n　「もしかして、お前にも春が…？！」\r\n　「な…？！」\r\n　ガトゥンはバランスを崩して危うく倒れそうになる。こほんと体勢を立て直し咳払いした頃には彼はけらけらと、「あのガトゥンがついにかー」などとからかい始めていた。\r\n　「んで、結局男？女？」\r\n　「お前には関係ないだろ。」\r\n　「なんだよ釣れねえなぁ…あ、もしかして人じゃないとか…」\r\n　友人に、はあ、とわざとらしくため息をついて目を瞑る。\r\n　「\"普通\"の人だよ。」\r\n　「へー。今度会わせてよ。」\r\n　「あほか。別に付き合ってないし…」\r\n　会ったのもこの間の一回きりで、そもそもこの辺りにすんでるのかさえも知らない。彼はそう付け加えようとして、しかし意味もなく顔をそらし目を開けた先で白髪の青年が視界に飛び込んできた。\r\n　どうした？と友人が呼び掛けたが、彼は飲み物が運ばれてきたことも気にせずにじっとそちらを伺っていた。その青年はもう一人の誰かの向かいに座って楽しそうに話していた。\r\n　似ている。そもそも彼女の他に白い瞳をもつ人物など見たことがなかった。ガトゥンは友人の呼び掛けを無視して立ち上がり、そちらへ向かっていく。そんな後ろ姿を「？」と見ながら彼は注文品に口をつける。\r\n　「ひ、久しぶり…」\r\n　なんと声をかけて良いのか…出てきた言葉は…そんな当たり前の文句であった。\r\n　「ん？」と青年は振り向く。口にはカラを咥えて上目遣いの表情に男は顔をそらす。\r\n　「……」\r\n　もくもくと残りを食べ終え、向かいの人が知り合い？と聞くのに彼は首を振る。\r\n　―え？\r\n　「いんや。…失礼ですけど、どなた？」\r\n　「え…と、はは、悪い…」\r\n　彼は踵を返すと自分の席へ戻っていく。背から「人違いだったのかな？」というもう一人の声が聞こえた。\r\n　\r\n　寝起きの下がり気味のテンションで朝食までは済ませたものの、今日も今日とてこれといってすることもなく、かといってこのままじっと屋内にこもるのも嫌で、扉から出てみた。無意識のうちに足は街の方へと向かい、段々人が増えていく。\r\n　通りのスポットには珍しいダクが入ったらしい。いつもは一度に2,3人が集まる程度のそこには不特定多数が覗きこんでいる。そんな様をあほらしいと見つめていると声がかかる。\r\n　「こんにちは。」\r\n　ガトゥンが振り向くと、そこには\"彼女\"がいた。\r\n　彼は彼女を見下ろしたままに手はあちこちに動かしながらも何事も言えずに顔を紅くさせる。\r\n　「…どうかしたんですか？」\r\n　一度会ったきりなのに知った風に話しかけるのはまずかったかなと彼女の方が困った顔をしてしまった。\r\n　「あ、いや…また会えるとは思わなくて。」\r\n　「この辺りに住んでるのなら、いずれ会いますよ。」\r\n　にこりとワカティプは微笑むと彼の手を引いた。\r\n　「今から用事ありますか？よろしければ…映画を見たいのですけど…」\r\n　彼女が言うには、見てみたいものがあるが、一人で見るにはジャンルが、という意味で怖いらしく、しかし友人と言える人物もおらずにガトゥンを誘ったのだという。他の人ならば、ならなぜわざわざ見に行くのだろうと捨ててしまうところだが、彼女に関してはかわいいなと思ってしまう自分に違和感しかない。\r\n　「お、おれなんかでいいのかな…」\r\n　「ええ。」\r\n　そもそも適当に出てきただけで用事などはない。気まぐれに感謝しつつ、二人は映画場へと向かった。\r\n　同時期に人気の高いシリーズの3作目がやっていたこともあり、場内はそれなりに賑わっていた。こんな世になっても映画を作る人たちはなかなか物好きだなと思う。上映より少し早い時間だったけれどスクリーン前の適当な席へとかけた。なるほどカップルか、二人連れが多かった。\r\n　ワカティプは隣でそわそわと肩を張っている。\r\n　「そんなに緊張しなくても…」\r\n　「い、いえ…その、私ほんとにこういうの苦手で…でも、一度大きなスクリーンで見てみたかったんです…」\r\n　ブザーがなると、部屋は暗くなってしまう。それだけで囁くような悲鳴をあげて腕を拘束される。\r\n　(ちょ、とワカティプっ)\r\n　(ごめんなさい…)\r\n　無論ガトゥンは嫌だから離せという意味で注意したのではない。驚いて、あまりにも警戒のない彼女を心配してであり、本心では舞い上がっていた。\r\n　それなりに力があるのか、彼女に締め付けられた腕がひりひりして前説を聞き逃してしまったとはいえ、彼は正直あまり怖いと思えなかったが。\r\n　隣のワカティプを横目にちらと見ると、震えながらも釘付けられたように見つめ続ける彼女がいて、恐怖とは別の恐ろしさがあるなと感心し、…少し嫉妬した。\r\n　「はあ…ごめんなさい、付き合わせてしまって…」\r\n　スタッフロールが流れ始めると観客たちはばらばらと立ち上がる。やがてそれも終わり明るくなってからさてと声をかけると、俯いたワカティプが更に頭を下げた。\r\n　「別に構わねーよ。暇だったし。」\r\n　「でも…とっても怖い映画です。付き合わせた上にそんな思いをさせてしまって…」\r\n　真面目な顔つきで青年は続ける。ガトゥンは苦笑いした。\r\n　「…大丈夫か？」\r\n　「ええ、まあ…ガトゥンは平気なんですか？」\r\n　内容も演出も定番で、初心者向けという印象だった。\r\n　「うーん…ワカティプって素直なんだな。」\r\n　カップルなんかは恐怖ごっこをしにきたのではないだろうか。そんな感想を漏らすと、どういう意味ですかと彼女は頬を膨らませて…しかしすぐにくすりと笑った。\r\n　「ふふ…映画は恐かったけど、誰かと見に来るのは楽しいですね。」\r\n　「…今までは、一人で？」\r\n　「ええ。…私、友達も家族もいませんから。」\r\n　ガトゥンはすぐにごめん…と謝るがワカティプは気にしていないようだった。\r\n　「ガトゥンさんは、きょうだいとかいるんですか？」\r\n　「いや、一人っ子だよ。両親は田舎に住んでる。」\r\n　ワカティプはそれ以上を催促するように目を輝かせたが、ひとまず出ようと適当な喫茶店へと誘った。\r\n　俺は自分の故郷のことを話した。土地のことも人物のことも話したが、彼女はどちらかというと後者に興味を持っていた。笑ったりムッとしたり困ったり、ころころと変わる表情になんとなく、こんな顔もできるんだって当たり前のことを思う。\r\n　「って…悪い、一方的に話しちまって。」\r\n　「いいんですよ。話を聞くのって楽しいですね。」\r\n　「ワカティプは、ずっとここに？」\r\n　なんてことない社交辞令に似た質問だったが、彼女は表情から笑みを消した。\r\n　「…ごめん。」\r\n　「…わからないんです。気がついたらここにいました。家族もいたはずなのに、\"いた\"という事実しか覚えていません。」\r\n　不思議な子だとは思っても、それを口にしてはいけないと、今日の映画の感想からも伺える。彼女は良い意味でも悪い意味でも素直で、言葉を真に受けてしまう上、目立つことは好まない。\r\n　しばらく沈黙が続いたが、ぱっと上げられた顔にはまた、笑顔が張り付いていた。\r\n　「ありがとうございます。とっても楽しかったです。」\r\n　「…俺の方こそ。」\r\n　思い付いたようにごそごそと持っていた鞄をあさって彼女はメモ帳を取り出す。そこへつらつらと何事かを書いていく。想像はついたが、彼女の連絡先だった。\r\n　「ちょっと、こんなものを…」\r\n　「よろしければまた会いましょう。」\r\n　彼女は、無防備だ。\r\n　「…ワカティプ、あんまりほいほいと渡したらダメだと思うぞ、こういうのは。」\r\n　こてんと首をかしげる彼女にそういうとこだぞと思いながらも込み上げてくるものがある。\r\n　「…ガトゥンさんは、いい人だって知ってますから。」\r\n　「まだ２回しか会ってないだろ。」\r\n　「知るのに回数や時間はただの目安です。」\r\n　ガトゥンは感じたことのない欲望を抑えるのに必死だったが、ふと彼女に友人がいないのがジェンダーの問題だと勝手に決めつけていたのかもしれないという考えが頭をよぎる。\r\n　―ワカティプの方が、人を選んでたのかな。\r\n　そこにはおそらく、願望も含まれていたのだろう。\r\n　それからそこまで日付もたたない頃、ガトゥンは変わった楽器の演奏会があることをきいてワカティプに連絡を取った。１日おいてOKという返事がきて、飛び上がるようにその日に想いを馳せた。\r\n　そして当日、広場の時計の下で彼はワカティプを待っていた。少し早すぎただろうかと待ち合わせ場所の見える程度に離れたベンチへ腰かける。体感的には無限の時間に思えたが、時計は正確に時刻を変えていった。広場の小ステージに人が集まりだす。器具が整えられ、演奏が始まる。それとなく観客を見回してみたが、ワカティプの姿はなかった。何曲か演奏がされると、奏者は頭を下げ拍手が彼を迎えた。人は散っていく。ガトゥンは持っていた端末で連絡を取るが応答なし。メッセージだけ録音しておいて暗くなった家路を辿った。\r\n　連絡が来たのは、それから１フシたってからであった。今すぐ会いたいのだと悲痛な声で告げられ、どうして断ることができよう。約束の場所まで彼は速足で歩いていった。外は雨が降っていた。\r\n　電灯だけが辺りを知らせる。彼女はぽつんと傘をさしてそこに立っていた。\r\n　「ワカティプ…」\r\n　「ガトゥンっ」\r\n　雨も気にせずに傘を放ってガトゥンの傘へと入り込み彼を抱き締める。無論彼は不謹慎だと思いながらも内心嬉しくなっていた。\r\n　「きらいにならないでっ…」\r\n　「お、落ち着けよ…」\r\n　彼は心の中で深呼吸すると片手で軽くワカティプの肩を押す。彼女の顔は雨か涙で濡れていた。\r\n　すすり泣くように興奮をおさめるとぽつぽつと彼女は説明をした。\r\n　「…あなたに誘われて、その日が待ち遠しかった…けど、気がついたらもう1フシも前になってて…私、約束…破りたくなんて…」\r\n　最後の\"なかった\"という言葉はもはや音とは呼べぬものだった。\r\n　「いいんだよ、無理しなくて…」\r\n　「今日だけじゃないの。」\r\n　え？とガトゥンは首をかしげたが、こんなとこではなんだと傘を拾って場所を変えた。\r\n　「ごめん、散らかってるけど。」\r\n　飲食店、発散ボックス、憩いの場…色々考えたが彼女が他人と会いたくないと言ったことから、彼の家へ招くことにした。\r\n　ワカティプは目を腫れさせてガトゥンの手をしっかりと握ったままだった。そんな調子なので茶も出せずに居間へ座った。\r\n　「…で、どういうこと？」\r\n　「気がついたら日付が変わってる…少し前からそういうことがあるんです。私は一晩寝ただけなのに。」\r\n　「ずっと寝ている…ってこと？」\r\n　ワカティプは首を振る。\r\n　「家事はこなされてますし、起きてはいるんだと思います…というか内装とかも変わってて…」\r\n　「…記憶障害？」\r\n　彼女の真っ白な瞳が色の白を映す。そんな顔で見上げられて奥底で何かが悲鳴をあげた。\r\n　「…そう、なんですかね。私…おかしいんでしょうか…」\r\n　「あ、いや…わかんないよ。ほら、例えば…酒にものすごく弱いとか。」\r\n　知り合いに少し飲むだけで記憶の飛ぶ奴がいたのを思い出す。\r\n　「お酒は嫌いです。それに、数日間の記憶がないんです。」\r\n　「そっか…」\r\n　彼女の肩は震えていた。ガトゥンはそっと、遠くの肩へ手を伸ばす。嫌がられるかなという不安と共に彼女を抱き寄せるように包み込む。抵抗はされなかった。\r\n　「…大丈夫。おれはあんたに惚れたんだ。自分を貫けるあんたに。約束なんか破っていい。…おれなんかじゃ迷惑かもだけど、おれはワカティプを嫌ったりしないよ。」\r\n　彼女はきゅっと目を瞑って首をほんの少し落とした。同時に来客を知らせるベルが鳴った。\r\n　「…悪い、ちょっと出てくるな。」\r\n　優しく離してみたが、案外彼女は反応しなかった。俯いて座ったまま。行ってほしくないと、裾でも引っ張ってくれはしないのかと勝手に残念に思った。\r\n　返事をして彼は戸を開けた。見知らぬ女性がにこりと挨拶した。\r\n　「…どなたですか？」\r\n　ガトゥンを微笑み返しはしたが、こんな時間に訪ねてくる心当たりもない人物に警戒は怠らなかった。\r\n　「はじめまして。私はタナと申します。」\r\n　整えられた茶の髪をさらりと寄せてお辞儀を終えるとさっそくですがと彼女は切り出す。\r\n　「お宅に白髪白眼の子がお邪魔していませんか？」\r\n　彼はその簡潔な説明にハッとする。すぐにワカティプが思い付いた。しかし、彼女は友人はいないといっていた。家族も…そもそも目の前の女性は彼女と似ていない。\r\n　「…何の用ですか？」\r\n　少しだけ目付きを鋭くさせる。が。\r\n　「…タナ？」\r\n　ワカティプの声ではあったが、それよりいくらか低いものが響く。振り返れば彼女が不思議そうにまっすぐ女性を見ていた。\r\n　「…し、知り合いなのか？」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　先程までの不安も恐怖も消え去ったように落ち着いている。そのまま玄関の境を跨いで出ていくのに、彼は焦りを感じた。\r\n　「おい…」\r\n　「もう、駄目じゃない。あの、保護してくださりありがとうございました。」\r\n　そんなガトゥンには目もくれずに青年の肩をぱっぱと払って彼へ向き直るとそうお礼をのべた。\r\n　「……？」\r\n　青年も事情がつかめぬとガトゥンとタナを交互に見る。\r\n　「ナセルくん、あなたまた変なところで眠り込んじゃったんでしょ。この人が匿ってくれたのよ。」\r\n　「え？そうなんすか？…ありがとございます。」\r\n　言われるがままにナセルと呼ばれた青年はぺこりとお辞儀した。何が何やら、反射的にガトゥンもどうも、と頭を下げる。\r\n　「あの、\"ナセル\"って…」\r\n　「あ、俺ナセルって言います。」\r\n　突然の自己紹介にガトゥンが目を丸くさせたのは言うまでもない。家にいたのはワカティプだけ。そもそも目の前の青年は見た目からも間違いなく彼女である。\r\n　「お、おい…なんかの冗談だろ？ワカティプ。」\r\n　「へ…？」\r\n　「……」\r\n　側でタナが見据えるようにガトゥンを見つめ、ナセルの手を引いた。\r\n　「ほら、帰りましょう。長居したら迷惑だから。」\r\n　「あ、うん。」\r\n　いつの間にか雨は止んでいた。タナはナセルと繋いだ手の反対に持った傘をこつりと少し先の地面へつける。\r\n　「では、さようなら。…後日、改めてお礼にうかがいますね。」\r\n　そのときのガトゥンには、その言葉は宣戦布告に聞こえたのだった。\r\n　\r\n　話し合った末に彼はようやく\"ワカティプ\"を理解した。そうしてあのときから2フシほどたったあとにまたワカティプが訪ねてきた。\r\n　「……」\r\n　彼女は、もう何を言ったらいいかわからないように、もう終わりだと言わんばかりの絶望顔でただガトゥンを見上げた。\r\n　「…入れよ。」\r\n　「でも…」\r\n　「大丈夫だから。」\r\n　ワカティプは首を振る。雫が一粒飛んで行った。\r\n　「あのあと…安心して、眠って

くり、カルーンへと振り向く。\r\n　開ききった目が、純粋な怒りを示していた。\r\n　少女は慌てて無神経だったと謝ったが、そんな言葉は聞こえぬように、\r\n　「お前\"も\"馬鹿にするんだな？！わからないのがなぜ悪い！！違う、わからないんじゃない、俺には初めからそんなものはないんだ…！俺にはそもそも何も…ッ」\r\n　そう言いながら、勢いづいたのかがくりと首を前方へと曲げる。しばらくそうして、少女に顔を見せぬように俯いていた。\r\n　「…………」\r\n　「………………………」\r\n　沈黙を破ったのは、彼の方だった。ハウェアはゆっくりと顔をあげる。表情からすっかり怒りは消えていた。それを見たカルーンが今度は顔を隠す。腰から前方へ倒れていた。\r\n　「ごめんなさい！…本当に…怒らせるつもりなんてなくて…ううん、もっと考えてから言うべきだったんだ…」\r\n　「……え？」\r\n　声音からも、か弱い力強さが消え失せていた。不思議に思って彼女は顔だけ上げて青年を見る。彼は考えるようなそぶりをみせ、何かにハッとしてきょろきょろと辺りを見回した。が、すぐに少女のことを思い出して、\r\n　「わっ、別にそんな謝んなくていーって…ほら、たぶん俺も悪かったと思うし…」\r\n　「すごく怒ってたよ？」\r\n　「ぅえ？！…いや、まあ、その…つい…日頃の、鬱憤とか？八つ当たりだよ、悪かった…」\r\n　青年は何とか逃れたいと後退りして腰に取っ手をぶつける。いてて…と擦っているのを見て、カルーンは訳もわからずに可笑しくなってしまった。\r\n　「あはは、何してんの…」\r\n　「あ、はは…じゃ、じゃあな。ほんと、悪かった…」\r\n　「いいよいいよ。私の方があなたの気持ち全然考えてなかったんだもん。」\r\n　ハウェアが戸を開けるのを、少女は穏やかに見つめていた。ばいばい、と手をふれば、苦笑いして振り返してくれた。\r\n　扉が閉まりきる直前、思いついてまた来てね！と叫んだのだが、聞こえたのか聞こえてないのかもわからぬまま、無情にも塞がれてしまう。\r\n　カルーンははぁ、とひとつため息をついた。\r\n　\r\n　今日は店を休みにして、出掛けると決めていた日だった。とはいえ、どこへ行こうか、まではあまり定まっていない。必要なものは揃っているし、所謂観光名所には興味が湧かなかった。\r\n　気分転換に丘に登るのがいいか、それとも雑踏を歩いた方が新鮮だろうか。うんうんと唸って、人にぶつかりそうになって、また歩いていく。彼女の思考を遮ったのは、いつか知り合った彼だった。\r\n　道路に人だかりができている。野次馬の様子から喧嘩か何かだろう。元気でいいなと、始めは通りすぎようとしたが、痛そうな音のあとに聞こえた周囲への怒声に聞き覚えがあって振り返る。\r\n　彼の身体にはいくつか傷があった。けれどもそれ以上に、感情面から震えているようだった。\r\n　―そうだ。あのとき彼は、恐がっていたんだ…\r\n　理由は皆目見当もつかぬが、今になって、他所から見つめなおして、以前の彼の不穏な態度に納得がいった。\r\n　やがて満足した野次達は道を歩いていく。喧嘩相手も友人らだろうか、が仕方なしとばかりに引きずっていった。\r\n　最後にカルーンとハウェアだけが残った。\r\n　少女はただ、荒く呼吸する青年を見つめていた。同情も心配もせずに、静かに彼が落ち着くのを待っていた。彼はおそらく限界だ。決して、体力が、という意味ではない。\r\n　以前出会ったときよりも遥かに弱い瞳の光で彼女をとらえたのは、通りすがる人が不審がるくらい後のことであった。\r\n　「……？なんだ、あんた…」\r\n　「人間が嫌いなの？」\r\n　青年は彼女を覚えていなかったのか、は？と目を細める。そんな彼を気にせずに、カルーンは彼の元へと詰め寄る。彼女とて、彼が自分のことを話すのを好まないことも、そうでなくともプライベートなことを突き詰めるのは失礼なことだともわかっていた。それでも、どうしても\"対象\"を知らないわけにはいかなかったのだ。\r\n　「君が嫌なのは、人？」\r\n　「はあ？」\r\n　「違うよね…うーん、なんだろ…確かあのときは、熱いの平気だって話してて…」\r\n　ハウェアはぶつぶつと何事かを告げ始めた彼女を白い目で見つめると、関わらぬに越したことはないと横を通りすぎていく。…が、空想に浸って彼を見てもいなかったはずのカルーンは的確に彼の腕を掴んだ。\r\n　「ねえ、ハウェアは何がそんなに恐いの？」\r\n　「な…何を……あれ、ハウェ、ア…？」\r\n　「君の名前、この前そう決めたじゃない。」\r\n　数回瞬きした後に、ああ、と短く納得したのを見て、カルーンはもう一度同じ質問をした。\r\n　「君はいつも恐がってる。恐怖と不安がいっぱいたまって、怒っちゃうんだよね。…一体何がそんなに恐いの？」\r\n　「怖い…？何の話だ。俺は別に何も怖くなんかない。」\r\n　そう言いつつ、彼は一歩、二歩と退がっていく。道路を本来歩く方向とは垂直に対面している彼らであったため、すぐに背中に物が当たった。\r\n　「どっかいけよ…お前も嫌いだ。腹が立つ。関わるなって、この前言っただろ…」\r\n　はて、とカルーンは首をかしげる。あの後確か…お互いに謝って和解したものとばかり思っていたのだが。面倒くさくなって適当にやり過ごしただけだったのだろうか。\r\n　内から外へと視線を変えれば、ハウェアが壁際に座り込んでいた。どうしたのだろうと数歩近づき、顔を覗き込むように前屈みになって、膝に手をつく。\r\n　「別にかっこわるくなんてないよ。話してごらんよ。他に話せる人もいないんでしょ？」\r\n　言ってから最後の一言は余計だったかなと珍しく気がついたのだが、青年は俯いたまま反応しない。それだけ参っているのだろう。カルーンは体勢を戻すと、数歩歩いてくるりと片足できれいに回る。そうしてすとん…とまっすぐ静かに彼の隣へと座った。\r\n　「……なんであんたは関わってくるんだ。」\r\n　「言ったでしょ、私、誰かと話すの好きなの。」\r\n　「人ならそこらにたくさんいる。」\r\n　誰かって、そういう意味じゃない、と少女はムッとした。そんな表情に青年が少しだけ顔を上げた。\r\n　「私ね、その日会った人、話したこと、色々纏めてるんだ。ほら、無神経だからさ、もっといろんな人と話すには、気遣いができなくちゃだめでしょ？…だから、どう思ったのかな、とか何が原因で怒ったのかな…って。まあ全然反映できてないんだけどさ…」\r\n　カルーンはひとつため息をついてから続ける。\r\n　「君は…なんだか薄っぺらいのに、中が見えないんだよね。あの日何が君を怒らせたのか…恐がらせたのか、全然わかんなくって。そのページだけ埋まってない。」\r\n　変わった奴だな、とハウェアは彼女を横目に見る。\r\n　「そんなこと、どうして気にするんだ。」\r\n　その問いに、だから、と彼女がもう一度説明しようとすると、そうではないとハウェアの落ち着いた声が遮り続けた。\r\n　「他人の顔なんか見なくていい。なんでわざわざ思ってもないのに嬉しいフリをする？…どっちがホントウなのか俺には判断がつかない。……\"ケイケン\"をつんでないから…」\r\n　少女は結局言葉の紡がれなかった口を閉じもせずに彼を見つめた。それは彼の情報不足から来る言葉足らずな発言を嘲ったためではない。感動した訳でもない。\r\n　ただ純粋に、自分が追いかけていた答えを見つけたからだった。\r\n　―彼が苦手だったのは、人そのものではない。\r\n　「そっか…だから君はあのとき怒ったんだね…」\r\n　「は？」\r\n　「やっと答えにたどり着いたよ。…ハウェア、そういうの、愛想笑い、とか社交辞令って言うんだよ。」\r\n　彼女の発した2語の内始めの方を、彼はたどたどしく繰り返した。それを聞いて少女は頷く。\r\n　「嫌だなーって思っても、相手にばれないようにするんだよ。嫌だなーって思われるのが、嫌な人はいっぱいいるからね。」\r\n　「…嫌なのかはっきりしない方が俺は嫌いだ。」\r\n　「まあ…そういう人もいるよね。ハウェアの場合はちょっと極端だけど…何にせよ、そうやって色々包み込んじゃったモノが、君は恐いんだよ。」\r\n　うんうんと一人納得してカルーンは頷くのだが、ハウェアには、怒りこそ沸くものの、怖いとはどうにも思えない。\r\n　その旨を伝えると自覚ないんだ、と少し驚かれてしまった。\r\n　―或いは、この不安定な感覚が、\"怖い\"、なのだろうか…\r\n　見上げた空は濁った海よりも色彩を失っていた。`","export

微笑みの裏側\r\n　\r\n　目の前の少年は本当に血が繋がっているのかと疑うほど平凡で魅力のない奴だ。そんな彼が道行きながら適当に選んだ店が旨い筈もなく、ただ周りの顔を伺って、あれの顔を立てて口へと詰め込むだけの苦痛な作業。一体どうして、この程度の友人しかいないのだろうかとの疑問は、所詮あれにはこれが限界かとの答えに即座に対応される。\r\n　なんてことのない…いや、つまらない方がいくらかましなのではないだろうか。\r\n　―それにしても。\r\n　ナセルの奴は何を考えているのだろう。何をしていた帰りか何をする前かはしらないが、わざわざ野郎と飯を食うこともあるまい。勢いとかノリとか…本当に色気のない。\r\n　「どうかした？」\r\n　「…ん？いや別にー…」\r\n　会話も弾んでないようだし…というか、\"代わってきた\"時点で何ら不満があったのだろうが。\r\n　「あ…えーと、これからどうしようか。」\r\n　「何が？」\r\n　だから、と少年は説明をする。どうやら予定が決まっていないらしい。\r\n　「あー…ま、オレ帰るわ。ちょっとやりたいことあるし。」\r\n　「そう？…わかった。…はあ、映画はまた今度か…」\r\n　ぽそりと少年はため息を漏らす。行きたいならそう言えばいいのに。なぜわざわざ「どうするか」などと尋ねて遠回りをしたのだろうか。\r\n　適当に運ばれてきたものを適当に食べ終わり、笑顔でそれじゃ、と別れる。肩の荷が下りたように力が抜けた。\r\n　オレのことは誰も知らない。知る必要なんかない。周りの人間にとって、オレは《ナセル》以外の何者でもない。今時二重人格なんて流行らないだろう？せいぜい頭のおかしい奴か目立ちたがりのどちらかだろうと苦笑いされるに決まっている。\r\n　幸い\"あれ\"の真似をするのにそう苦労はいらなかった。もし、きちりとした奴だったら、少しの気まぐれも不審に思われるだろう。が、気まぐれの塊みたいな奴なのだ。走ろうが踊ろうが知人さえ気にはしない。\r\n　暇人の集う帰路を辿っていく。本当はやることもやりたいこともありはしないのだが、誰かと別れるのには理由をつけた方がいいだろう。\r\n　前方から男が歩いてくる。\r\n　これからどうしようか。とりあえずは家に帰るとして、それから…\r\n　「今帰りか？…なんというか、中途半端な時間だな。」\r\n　正面からやって来た人物がこちらを向いてそう告げる。\r\n　「はは…まあ、急用を思い出して？」\r\n　さて彼は誰だったろうか…記憶を辿って顔を一致させていく。が、これといって思い当たる人物はいなかった。少なくとも\"自分\"には。\r\n　「そりゃ悪かった。じゃあ。」\r\n　急な用事ってのはなかなか便利な物だな。内容なんかすっからでも、何となく許されてしまう。\r\n　話しかけてきた奴はそのまま真っ直ぐ歩いていった。\r\n　……\r\n　…\r\n　\r\n　どんと、肩が叩かれて空と地面がひっくり返る。また叩き起こされたことだけがわかって目線だけで辺りを見渡す。ここは…？\r\n　飾りすぎず簡素すぎず、素材の香りが残るほど丁寧に手入れされた壁や床。そして、\r\n　「どうしたの？」\r\n　まるで幾重にも響いて輝く輪を造るように綺麗な声がした。ぞっとするような、喜びを通り越した寒気に襲われて、短い疑問の音だけが漏れた。\r\n　―どうして彼女が？\r\n　ここに、こうして二人のんびりと寛いでいるということは、彼女の家であろうか。それにしたって、訳がわからない。\r\n　―彼女の前で、あれが代わるなんて…\r\n　本当にいい加減で憎たらしい。\r\n　「…大丈夫？」\r\n　彼女は微笑んで気遣うように―いつの間にか席を立ちこちらへと移動していた―膝をやや曲げて覗き込む。\r\n　頭が回らない。\r\n　本当は、いつもの通り「ナセル」のフリをしなくてはならないのに。\r\n　「いや、その…っ」\r\n　「顔が赤いわね…ちゃんと休んでる？」\r\n　「へ、平気…」\r\n　どうしても直視ができない。失礼だと思いながらも片腕で顔を隠しつつ目をそらす。なんせ実際に\"会うのははじめて\"なのだ。\r\n　ずっと、ただ憧れていた。《ナセル》のいる限り、決して叶わぬ夢だと。\r\n　「ほんと…ごめん…オレ……」\r\n　「……………」\r\n　情けなくて、理由が見つからなくて言い訳なんかしたくなくて…どうしたものかと渦巻くばかり。さっさともとに戻りやがれと思いつつも、この瞬間を噛み締めたくもある。\r\n　「…ごめんな…ね。…たで…う？」\r\n　何も耳に入らない。いや、聞こえてはいるのだが解釈される前に抜けていってしまっているようだ。\r\n　彼女が何かを告げている。聞かなければ。\r\n　「私は……の。」\r\n　理解しなければ。\r\n　けれども達成される前にまた、気まぐれが訪れるのだ―\r\n　\r\n\r\n　「え？また新しい人格が？」\r\n　ヴァレンは驚いて机を拭いていた手を止める。\r\n　「ええ…私を見てとても驚いてたわ。すぐに気がついてあげられればよかったんだけど…」\r\n　てっきり、ナセルのままなのだと思って接してしまったことをタナは悔やむ。\"彼\"または\"彼女\"はおそらく自分の知っている誰でもない。そうであるならば、相手もまた、自分が誰かわからず、そんな不安の中で受け答えてくれたのだろう。\r\n　「でも、よくわかったね。その人は何も言わなかったんでしょ？」\r\n　「ええ、きっと優しい子なのね。誰だとか、その類いのことは何も。」\r\n　それどころか、\"平気だ\"とさえ答えていた。\r\n　「また、会えるかしら。」\r\n　「さあ…はあ。一体何人いるのやら…」\r\n　\r\n　気がつけば夜道を歩いていた。ここ最近は少し多いような気がする。あの気分屋にも、それなりに悩みがあるのだろうか。それにしてもまたこの少年と遊んでいるとは…仲がよろしくて何よりだ。\r\n　「あ、ねえナセル。この前貸してくれた本だけど…」\r\n　また何かを押し付けたのか。弟は鞄から小さな冊子を取り出す。まさかそれではないだろうと冗談混じりに見ていたらそれが単なるメモであるというような説明が続いた。どうでもいいことだ。あれの私物がどうなろうとオレの知ったことではない。\r\n　「ああ、別に構わねーよ？」\r\n　「ごめん、後から許可とって…」\r\n　もうずっと借りられたままでも気づかないんじゃないだろうか。\r\n　「あー、くたびれた。帰ったら寝るぞ～」\r\n　「ほんっと、ちょっとはしゃぎすぎたなぁ。」\r\n　何で、と聞かれたらむしろオレが聞きたい。所詮その程度の知識でそれなりの会話ができてしまう。そんなつまらない人生を、オレ達は送っているのだ。\r\n　―かといって、刺激が欲しいとも思えないが。\r\n　このままでいいんだ。この間みたいなトラブルはなし。オレはオレのまま、俺として、密かに…\r\n　\r\n　\r\n　ここは…とタナが手で示せば彼女はあ…と理解してコツコツ進めていく。もう半分くらいできたのではないだろうか。そうであるのに、中弛みすることなく丁寧に一つずつ彼女はそれを作り上げていく。そこに確かな敬愛があるからだろう。\r\n　「ふふ、本当にロトルアちゃんはラックさんが好きなのね。」\r\n　「へ…？」\r\n　彼女はいつものように真っ赤になって謙遜する。ここ最近―といってもあくまでロトルアにとってだが―彼女はタナのところへ来てはマフラーの編み方を教わっていた。勿論ラック・ローズへ渡すためだ。いつも絵を描いてもらうからお礼がしたいと、彼女は姉のような存在のタナへと相談した。\r\n　そろそろ休憩にしよう、とタナは茶器を用意する。ロトルアも立ち上がって手伝いをする。\r\n　「ありがとう。あ、これはそっちへお願いできるかしら。」\r\n　着々と準備が進められ、すぐにジョフ・ガウだ。二人はゆっくり、なんということのない話をしながら午後を楽しむ。\r\n　やがてロトルアがうつらうつらして首を傾けた。集中して疲れたところにこの穏やかな気温、適度に腹が満たされれば眠りたくなるのも無理はないだろう。タナが休んで良いのよ、と優しく毛布をかけると、大丈夫ですとの言葉とは裏腹にパタリと彼女は夢の世界へ落ちていった。\r\n　さて、とタナは座り直す。今日の夕飯はどうしようだとか、この間友人の言っていた店へはいつ行こうかなどを、彼の寝顔を見つめながら考えていた。\r\n　\r\n　ぴくりと僅かに腕が動いた。けれどもラーセは眠ったままの姿勢でそれ以上動こうとはしなかった。\r\n　「…名前、何て言うの？」\r\n　そんな彼へタナは問いかける。彼が目覚めていることも、それが\"彼\"であるのだということも彼女にはわかっていた。もう間違えはしない。\r\n　対して彼の方はどういう意図でそう告げたのかを考える。相変わらず面と向かって会話することはできそうにないし、そもそもどうして今更名前などを聞いたのだろうか。\r\n　―このまま、寝たフリを続けるべきか…\r\n　「…何、言ってんだよ…ナセル、だろ。」\r\n　僅かな欲が許してくれなかった。\r\n　彼女はその答えに驚きの声をあげる。\r\n　彼は彼女のその疑問に疑問をもつ。暫しの沈黙。\r\n　「…あなた、もしかしてナセル君を知ってるの？」\r\n　一体何をとぼけているのだとの思いとは別のところで、感づかれているのではと不安になる。原因があるとしたら、この間の失敗だろう。\r\n　「俺の…ことだろ？」\r\n　けれども引くわけには…\r\n　「…いいえ、あなたは《ナセル》君じゃないわ。」\r\n　タナのその言葉で、彼は初めて口以外を動かした。両手で耳を覆うように屈んだのだ。閉じた隙間からくぐもった心配の音が聞こえる。\r\n　―悪い、ナセル…\r\n　ずっと憎んでいなくなって欲しいのに、自分は所詮\"彼\"の望みのために存在しているのだと信じて疑えなかった。\r\n　オレが\"彼\"でないことを知ったら、きっと彼女は…\r\n　彼はしばらくそうしていて、タナは落ち着くのを待つため座り直す。\r\n　\r\n　「……いつから…？」\r\n　顔は伏せたまま、何度も彼に謝りながら、現状を受け入れることにした。…もはやどう誤魔化せるのかもわからないし、彼女に嘘をつくのが苦しかったのだ。\r\n　「この前会ったとき。ごめんなさいね、途中まではてっきりナセル君だと思っていて…」\r\n　「…ごめん。」\r\n　「あら、どうしてあなたが謝るの？」\r\n　理由など、考えるまでもない。\r\n　彼女は優しいから、その答えを口にしないだけで…\r\n　「オレが、《ナセル》じゃない、から…本当にごめん、騙して。もう、出ないから…」\r\n　だからどうか、\r\n　「あいつは本当に何も知らないんだ。あいつは嘘なんかついてない。君を騙したりは…できない、から…」\r\n　どうか彼を嫌わないでほしい。\r\n　最後に一目だけ、と一瞬顔をあげる。もう出ない。彼女の前には、絶対に…\r\n　「…また、会いましょうね。」\r\n　そう、誓おうと思ったのに。\r\n　最後に見た彼女は、その言葉と共に微笑んでいた。\r\n　\r\n　結局、名前さえ知ることは叶わなかった。\r\n　目の前で再び眠りについた青年を見つめて、タナはひとつため息をついた。\r\n　―随分と消極的な子だったな。\r\n　けれども自己評価の極端に低いロトルアとはどこか違う。それに…\r\n　「…ナセル君だけを、知ってるのかしら。」\r\n　それがなんとも不思議であった。\r\n　他の誰もが誰しもを知らない。けれども先程の子だけは、全てを知るでなく一人を認識している…\r\n　「ん…あれ、俺いつの間にタナん家来てんだ…？」\r\n　「ふふ、おはよう。」\r\n　彼は何も知らない。\r\n　あの子もそう言っていた。\r\n　「ナセル君、楽しい？」\r\n　「はは…どうしたんだよ急に。」\r\n　「ううん、何でもないの。あなたが幸せならいいわ。」\r\n　今日変だぞ？と彼は裏表なく笑っていた。\r\n　\r\n　―またね。\r\n　その言葉は社交辞令か、それとも。\r\n　悩んだって、仕方がない。もう出ないって決めるんだ。あれにどれだけ\"呼ばれ\"ても、もう知らない。バレてしまったら居場所はない。オレは所詮《ナセル》の裏側。あれの代わり身。\r\n　―名前、か。\r\n　そんなものは考えたこともなかった。必要がないから。オレはオレだけに認識される。なら、\"オレ\"で十分じゃないか…\r\n　けれどももし許されるのなら…\r\n　彼女の名を、呼んでみたかった。\r\n　\r\n　\r\n　目が白黒する。ぱっと明るくてチカチカと頭をつつく。…どうやら昼間の大通りのようであった。人はたくさんいるが、食事のためにそこらの建物へ入っていくから、どこか寂しかった。\r\n　「…ん？」\r\n　違和感は足の涼しさだった。そこだけ着物の感覚がなくて、なんだか落ち着かない。\r\n　「な…？！」\r\n　「うおっ…どうした？」\r\n　驚いて一歩後ずされば、隣にいた男も声をあげた。\r\n　…どこかで見たことがあるような。\r\n　「大丈夫か？」\r\n　「いや…なん、でもない…」\r\n　それよりも目の前の状況の整理だ。ここまで親しそうに話しかけるからにはどうせ友人か何かだろう。問題は、なぜ\"俺\"がこんなヒラヒラとした物を身に付けているか、だ。正直気色が悪い。\r\n　「…その、無理しなくていいぞ？やっぱ着替えるか？」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　「ほら、どうせくだらない罰ゲームなんだから…」\r\n　―罰ゲーム？\r\n　「あ…うん、やっぱ恥ずかしいな。着替えたい…」\r\n　「あ、ああ…まあ、あいつらには俺から上手く言っとくよ…」\r\n　はっきり言って状況は未だ全くつかめない。どことなく、男も適当に言葉を並べているだけにも聞こえる。けれど、もしそうだとしたら…考えるのはやめよう。\r\n　ひとつため息をついて家へと歩きだす。店で着替えてもいいのだが、生憎この辺りにその手の建物はなさそうだった。成り行きか男も後をついてきた。\r\n　さて、一体どこで見かけたか…\r\n　ぼーっと、あまり真面目に思い出しもしないで帰路を辿る。が、\r\n　「あら、ガトゥンさん。」\r\n　―！\r\n　「ああ、こんにちは。」\r\n　「ふふ、今から帰り？」\r\n　「ええ、まあ…」\r\n　「…ご飯、食べないの？」\r\n　ガトゥンが声の主を振り替える。\"彼女\"は少し寂しそうに見上げていた。\r\n　「最近、会えてませんでしたから…」\r\n　「ワカティプ…？」\r\n　いいんです、とワカティプは背を向ける。慌ててガトゥンが疲れているようにみえたからと機嫌を取る。タナはそんな二人をにこりと見つめて、邪魔しちゃわるいなと挨拶した。\r\n　「本当に大丈夫か？」\r\n　「平気です…だって、せっかく…」\r\n　そう言いながらふらりと彼女は倒れこむ。焦ったガトゥンがなんとかその身体を受け止めた。\r\n　「お、おい…？」\r\n　「う…み、られた…」\r\n　ラーセは支えられていた腕をひっぺがして頭を抱える。ひどく混乱しているようだった。声をかけてみても落ち込むばかりで歩き出そうともしない。仕方ないなと彼はしばらく落ち着くのを待っていた。\r\n　\r\n　最悪だ。\r\n　罰ゲームだか何だか知らないけど、よりにもよってこんな姿を見られるなど。今度こそ、失望してしまっただろう。どう言い訳したのかもよく覚えていない。\r\n　もはや帰る気力もない。他の誰にどう見られようが問題なくなってしまった。\r\n　「なあ…とりあえず、帰らないか？」\r\n　きっとこいつのせいだ。そうだ、そうじゃないと…\r\n　「お前のせいだ！オレがこんな…こんな…っ…」\r\n　「悪かったよ…」\r\n　「もう終わりだ…」\r\n　今更喚いたところで仕方あるまい。なかったことにはできないのだ。\r\n　絶望する青年を見つめてガトゥンは仮説をたてる。無論彼にも\"彼\"がワカティプでないことはわかっているが、かといってならば\"誰\"なのかはわからなかった。突然態度が変わった前後に起こったことは、一瞬だけワカティプが戻ってきたことと、後は…\r\n　持っていた端末を操作する。\r\n　とはいえ、だ。\r\n　―これが\"ナセル\"…な訳ないよな。\r\n　おそらく、自分の知っている彼ならばたとえそんな姿をタナに見られたところで恥ずかしがるどころか話のネタにするだけだろう。けれども目の前の彼は、彼女に不本意ながら知られて絶望しているようだ。\r\n　やがてタナが戻ってきた。\r\n　「どうかしたの？」\r\n　「ああ、ちょっとこの子が…」\r\n　「…………」\r\n　タナは\"彼\"に気づくとぱっと笑顔になって上体を傾ける。\r\n　「久しぶりね、元気だった？」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　さすがだな、とガトゥンは感心して、呼び戻して良かったと安堵する。どうやら彼女の知り合いのようだ。\r\n　「………」\r\n　「…何か不安？」\r\n　タナは驚かせないように、落ち着かせるために笑顔を絶やさなかった。少なくとも彼はそう思っていた。\r\n　「…代われ、ない…」\r\n　「え？」\r\n　先程から何度もやっている。けれどもあれは全然呼び掛けに答えない。出ようとしない。元々気まぐれだけがどちらなのかを制御していたから、当たり前と言えばそうなのだが…\r\n　「もう、出ないって…言ったのに…オレには、どうすることもできなくて…」\r\n　「………」\r\n　タナさん、とガトゥンが耳打ちする。\r\n　「この子はまさか…わかってるのか？」\r\n　「…あなたは、ナセル君を知ってるのよね？」\r\n　青年はこくりと頷く。彼女以外がそこにいるとわかっていながら。彼が何者かを知らないままでも。\r\n　「オレは…ナセルの裏側だから。」\r\n　きっと何を馬鹿なと呆れられているだろうと認めて、青年は説明した。\r\n　「オレに権利はない。\"俺\"がどちらでいられるかは、あれが決めるから。」\r\n　そんなものは言い訳でしかないが。\r\n　「…そう。じゃあ、今度はいつ会えるのかわからないわね。」\r\n　「そんな優しさはいらない！…オレには、必要ない…オレがお前らに不要なのはわかってる！けど、どうしようもないんだ。オレには、\"出ない\"ってことも出来なくて…」\r\n　憎い。\r\n　自由なあいつが。\r\n　「君に迷惑なんかかけたくない。オレのことなんか嫌って蔑んでもらって構わない。だけど…っ」\r\n　彼女の好きな、自分が…\r\n　「だけど…」\r\n　「おいおい、彼女がいつ\"君\"を嫌いだなんて言ったんだ？」\r\n　「お前には関係ないだろ！」\r\n　青年が叫んで、タナが一歩踏み出した。\r\n　「…！」\r\n　そしてガトゥンの言い分を証明するかのように、彼に口づけた。\r\n　人目につかない小さな道でなくとも、彼女はそうしたのだろう。やれやれ、とひとつため息がつかれた。\r\n　「…ナセル君にも、したことないのよ？」\r\n　タナがいたずらっぽく笑ってみせる。\r\n　「え…」\r\n　解放されて青年は一歩さがる。\r\n　「私はあなたのこと、もっと知りたいわ。彼とあなたのこと、そして、彼と\"関係のない\"あなたのことも…」\r\n　彼はゆっくりと首を振る。未だに信じられなくて、喜びの感情がやってこない。勝っただなんて、誇れない。\r\n　「でもこれって、世間で言う二股になるのかしら…ほら、私だって普通の人間じゃないんだわ。」\r\n　「そんな…こと…」\r\n　自分が認識されることは、恐ろしいことだと思っていた。\r\n　彼は俯いてしばらく整理して、そうして顔をあげた。その真っ白な瞳がまっすぐ彼女を見つめる。\r\n　―本当はこんなにも怖いことなのだ。\r\n　本来あるはずのない\"自分\"。決してあってはならないもの。\r\n　「オレは…いてもいいのか？」\r\n　「勿論よ。だいたいそれは、私が決められることじゃないもの。」\r\n　彼には自分の格好だとか、もう一人の人物が誰であるかなどもうどうでもいいことに思えていた、が、安心したら急に恥ずかしさがやってくる。はっとして手で隠すように慌てて、説明しろと彼を睨んだ。\r\n　「大丈夫よ、気にしてないから。服装も予定も自由な世の中なんだから。」\r\n　「け、けど…オレはほんとにこんな趣味は…いや、かといって、あいつにもない…と思うけど…」\r\n　あったら、なんか嫌だ。\r\n　「はは…悪ふざけで、着せたんですよ…」\r\n　無論どうしてそのような姿なのかを彼女が知っていることは、ガトゥンにもわかっていが、\"彼\"が\"彼女\"を認識していないなら適当に説明する素振りを見せるしかない。\r\n　「もう、仲良いんだから。」\r\n　「いや…今日はちょっと調子のりすぎかな…？」\r\n　優しい嘘は彼らの日常。知らないことを無理に突きつける必要はない。知りたいと言われたときだけ言えばいい。\r\n　ひとしきり笑った後、そういえばとタナが以前から気にしている彼の名前について切り出した。恥ずかしさを終えてまた顔を強ばらせる。\r\n　「……ルセナ」\r\n　少しの間をあけて聞こえた音にはじめはガトゥンもタナも不思議な響きだと関心を示した。\r\n　彼には名前などない。だからその場で、最も相応しいと思うものを呟いたのだ。気づいたのはガトゥンだった。\r\n　「…ん？ちょっとまて。それは、ナセルを意識してるのか？だったらそれは\"お前\"の名前じゃない。」\r\n　タナも気づいて頷く。けれども青年は首を振り、頑なにそれでいいのだと主張した。\r\n　「…いいんだ。オレは所詮ナセルの影。存在が許されようと、それは変わらない。オレは…ナセルが不満を持ったときに出てくるんだ。あいつの代わりに、事を済ませるために。」\r\n　二人は顔を見合わせる。なんというか…まるでどこかの物語にでも出てきそうな、典型的なものを彼は想像しているようだ。\r\n　「ええと…あなたもしかして、本とか読む？ナセル君は全くだけど…」\r\n　ルセナは不思議そうに頷く。目覚めたばかりで右も左もわからずに、それでも文字は読めたので、情報収集をしたことを告げる。ガトゥンもタナも苦笑いする。\r\n　だって彼らは、そうでないことを知っているから。\r\n　「けどなぁ、あのナセルが、そういう悩みを持ってるかな。こう言っちゃ悪いかもだが、とんでもなく楽観的だろう？そりゃ、多少の悩みはあるだろうが、お前の言うような\"誰かに代わってほしい\"程のことはなさそうだろ。」\r\n　それは…と彼は反論をしようとして口ごもる。前々から、疑問ではあったのだ。\r\n　「他の人がどう思うかはわからないけど、私もガトゥンさんも、あなたのやるべきことはそんな事じゃないと思ってるわ。」\r\n　「…どういう、ことだ？」\r\n　「あなたは\"たまたま\"実体をナセル君と共有していて、それを認識しているだけ。だからって彼を意識することはなくて、あなたはただ、あなたらしくいればいいのよ。」\r\n　彼女の笑顔は、言葉から意味を剥がしてしまいそうになるほど美しかった。だから…\r\n　―本当に、いいのだろうか。自分は、俺以外のオレとして、あってもいいのだろうか。\r\n　目の前の彼らはそれを認めてくれている。オレとあれが別人だと、解ってくれる。\r\n　それなら…\r\n　「…名前。教えてほしい。君の…」\r\n　私？とタナは自分を指差す。彼はこくりと頷いて頬を染めた。\r\n　「そうね、あのときは混乱してたものね。…私はタナ。そしてこっちが、」\r\n　「ガトゥンだ。」\r\n　青年はそっと目を閉じる。そうして心でその名を復唱した。\r\n　―タナ。\r\n　暖かい。自分が、これまでにないほど心地よい風に満たされている。\r\n　「ありがとうタナ。それに、ガトゥンも。」\r\n　表も裏も消えた微笑みに、呼ばれた二人は嬉しくなる。\r\n　「じゃあ、名前も解決しましょうか。…何かあるといいんだけど…」\r\n　あなたや君ではやはり不便だ。彼は少し考えると、目の前の二人が提案を口にする前に\"トシュカ\"と音にした。\r\n　彼らが戸惑いを隠せずに、また不安そうに見つめていた。\r\n　「…それでもやっぱり、オレはあいつの側にいたい。わかってる、あれはオレじゃない。けど、一緒にいたい相手なんだ。今ならわかる。これは…」\r\n　憎しみじゃない。\r\n　ずっと、その場所が、その気まぐれがオレは―\r\n　「きっとオレは、ナセルに憧れてるんだ」\r\n　少しだけ沈黙が訪れる。タナが唖然と見つめる中、ガトゥンは笑いが抑えきれず吹き出してしまった。\r\n　「珍しい奴だな。ナセルを尊敬するなんて…いや、あの自由さはある意味…？」\r\n　「ああ、そうさ。憎らしいほど気まぐれなんだ。周りの気も知らないで」\r\n　たしかに、と苦笑いする隣の彼女の口許も、もう緩んでいた。\r\n　「…それじゃあ、改めてよろしくね。トシュカ君。」`","\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nimport

const novel = `クノーテンはいつものように広場へ来ると、「よう！遊ぼうぜ！」と元気よく声をあげる。広場には大人子供、ヒトビトコレン関係なく集まり何かの準備をしていた。なんだろうと彼らの顔を次々と見ていると近くにいたよく遊ぶ子が教えてくれる。\r\n　「今度祭があるから、しばらくは準備で遊べないんだ。」\r\n　「準備？私も手伝うよ。」\r\n　クノーテンは状況を知ると同じようにしゃがみこむ。しかし周りの者たちは驚いて彼を見つめ、慌てて止めた。\r\n　「だ、だめだよ。クノーテンはフィアデンだから。」\r\n　「え？」\r\n　「クノータデンス様、これは我々の感謝なのです。どうかお手を貸さないでくださいまし。」\r\n　クノーテンは立ち上がると辺りを見回す。誰もが首を横に振った。\r\n　「祭は我らからフィアデンの方々への日々の感謝を伝えるもの。どうか私たちの手で準備させてください。」\r\n　「ああ、そういう…？」\r\n　流されるように言いくるめられてクノーテンは家である屋敷へと帰っていく。広場の者たちはひと安心とため息をついた。\r\n　町での祭は毎年行われており、クノーテンも以前参加したことはある。けれどもそのときはただそこにいろといわれていてわけもわからず成り行きを見守っていただけであったし、彼が他の種族の子供たちと遊び始めたのは自由な外出許可の出たついこの間のことであった。そのため追い返されるのは初めてで微妙に納得がいかない。\r\n　彼が屋敷へ戻ると、そこでも慌ただしく準備が進められていた。\r\n　「あ、セーレン！」\r\n　クノーテンは階段を上がり、廊下で片割れを見つけると彼のところへ駆け寄った。\r\n　「クノーテン…」\r\n　「なんだぁ、その服…」\r\n　思わず笑いがこみ上げてきて少年は口を押さえる。\r\n　セーレンは金や銀の装飾のついた生成りの見慣れぬ衣を纏っていた。\r\n　「これは、その…」\r\n　「もしかして、祭で着るのか？」\r\n　クノーテンが笑顔で尋ねるとセーレンは静かに頷く。\r\n　「あはは、お前って白似合うよな。」\r\n　「そんなことない…」\r\n　セーレンの背後から使用人が早歩きにこちらへ来る。そうして彼を案内するように手をひいた。セーレンは一度彼を見たが、クノーテンはがんばれよーと手を振ると静かに頷いて別の方向へ歩みを進めていった。さて何をしようか。フィアデンも、それ以外も、祭りの準備で忙しい。別に邪魔する気はないし…けれどもフィアデンであり、フィアデンでない自分はどちらかを手伝うことも叶わない。これから数日はこんな生活が続くのかと思うと、気が滅入りそうだ。\r\n　一番邪魔にならないところは…やはり自室であろう。ドアを消していつもの狭い空間。机の横のクッションにピョンと座り、壁に埋め込まれた棚から本をひとつ取り出す。この部屋が与えられたときから、本棚には本が揃っていた。クノーテンが持ち込んだものは何一つない。\r\n　本は主にフィアデンに関すること。今思えば身をわきまえろとの警告なのか、単に置くものがなかっただけか…破れたページもあることから使い古しの処分かもしれない。\r\n　クノーテンは部屋を与えられると、しばらく自室へ籠っていた。自ら進んでではなくそうなることを余儀なくされていた。そのときに他にやることもなく、本は読み尽くしてしまった。だから今は適当にパラパラと捲るのみ。初めてこれを読んだときのことを思い出しながら。閉じ込められ、彼は次第に自我を失っていた。もうすべてがどうでもよくなっていた。自分はこのままここで果てるのだろうか。それとも他の役割のため今はこうして隠れるようにいるのだろうか。そんなことさえ考えなくなった。\"示された通り\"本に書かれた内容を知るだけ。そんな日々が続いていた。\r\n　助けてくれたのは…セーレンだった。彼には珍しく、今にも泣きそうにしがみついてきた。たぶん、彼が泣くのも怒るのも、その時が初めてだったと思う。\r\n　「その根本は、世界である。フィアデンは世界そのものに繋がる顕現態―」\r\n　そこまで読むと、らしくないと本を捨てた。\r\n　―祭って、どんなものだっけ。\r\n　美味しいものが食べられる場所？ヒトビトやコレンと遊べる場所？不思議な光が見られること？\r\n　…彼にとってはせいぜいその程度の知識上の存在であった。\r\n　\r\n　「クノーテン？」\r\n　扉の向こうから声が聞こえた。そんな風に自分を気遣ってくれるものなど、彼しかいない。けれども。いや、彼だからこそ今は会いたくなかった。きょうだいにこんな顔は見せられない。\r\n　「最近、会えてない…外に出てない？」\r\n　「ここにいるよ。やることねえから。…入ってくんな。」\r\n　見えはしないが、たぶん小さく頷いたのだろう。彼は自分の言うことには何でも従った。それは決して、同情からではないだろう。彼は自らの力を特殊だとは思っていない。ただそれが当たり前なのだ。だからせめて自分だけでも味方につけばなどとは考えない。それよりもむしろ―\r\n　そもそもセーレンは、初めからクノーテンの命令に忠実だったわけではない。あれはそう、彼が生まれて初めて泣き、怒った時からだ。あのときから決して抗わなくなった。となれば。自分から離れぬよう、留めておくように嫌がることをしないのだろう。けれどもそれはクノーテンにはありがた迷惑というもの。おかげでますます王や他のフィアデンは冷たくなった。\r\n　何をするでもなく、しないでもなくまた月日は過ぎていった。\r\n　\r\n　朝から屋敷が、町全体が騒がしく影がいくつも通りすぎていく。クノーテンが廊下の窓からそれらを眺めていると、セーレンが正装に身を包んでやって来た。\r\n　「クノーテン…」\r\n　「ん？どうした、行った方がいいんじゃないのか？」\r\n　「クノーテンは見ててくれる？」\r\n　セーレンはフィアデンの皇子として、祭では式典に参加しなければならない。そこではちょっとした披露もするのだと聞いた。\r\n　「ありゃ、ヒトビトやコレンに向けてのお礼だろ？私が見てどうすんだよ。」\r\n　「…元気でるから。」\r\n　クノーテンははあ、とため息をつくときっと見るから、と頷いた。それだけでぱっと明るくなって、無愛想な彼にしてはかなりの笑顔を見せた。セーレンが去り、さて何か食べてみようかとクノーテンは広場へ向かう。おいしそうないい匂いがあちこちからする。ポケットに手を突っ込むと小袋を出す。\r\n　「あ、クノーテン。」\r\n　「よう。」\r\n　仲のいい子が肩を叩いた。\r\n　「何してるんだ？」\r\n　「コルを数えてんだよ。なんか買おうと思って。」\r\n　クノーテンは辺りの店を見回し値段を確認する。声をかけてきた子はぽかんと口を開けた。\r\n　「何言ってんだよ。フィアデンはタダに決まってるだろ？祭なんだから。」\r\n　「え？」\r\n　少年は回想してみたが、よく覚えていない。けれどもそもそもコルを渡して物を買うことを知ったのは外出するようになってからであった。\r\n　「…けどなあ…悪くないか？」\r\n　「取る方が気を使うって。それに、フィアデンがもらってった数でどの店が一番か、なんて勝負もあるんだぜ。遠慮せずすきなの取れよ。」\r\n　そういって彼は巾着を出すと、近場にあった軽食店にこれをくれとコルを差し出した。クノーテンもおそるおそる俺も、と聞いてみる。店主の親父は笑顔になってあいよ、と答えた。なんだか久しぶりな感覚がした。購入したおやつを食べながらもう一人と歩いていく。\r\n　「紙抜きやろうぜ。」\r\n　「なんだそれ？」\r\n　彼の指の先には板枠に紙を張ったものへボールを投げる子供たちがいた。\r\n　「あれも…コルはいらないのか？」\r\n　「もちろん。」\r\n　少年たちはそちらへ駆けていった。\r\n　\r\n　舞台の上や、光の当たるところはあまり好きではない。一緒にいられないから。\r\n　セーレンは椅子に座って出番を待つ。それまでは店を回っていいと大人は彼とアインに告げたが、彼は首を振った。\r\n　「セルミアーデン様、式典までにはもう少しお時間があります。出店を回られては…？」\r\n　どこからかフィアデンの使用人がやってくると少年に話しかける。彼は使用人を一瞥するも、無言のまま正面へと向き直る。\r\n　「今日ばかりは羽を伸ばされてよいのですよ。」\r\n　「あんなところ、楽しくない。」\r\n　「では、何か欲しいものは。」\r\n　「クノーテン。」\r\n　使用人は困ったような顔でお辞儀をすると、そそくさと去っていく。別に要求を聞いて呼びに行ったわけではない。それはできぬと、聞いてないことにしたのだ。\r\n　\r\n　ポン、ポンと弾ける音がするとヒトビトもコレンもフィアデンも一斉に集まりだす。店はしまり、通りには誰もいなくなる。クノーテンは見つからないようにこっそりと輪の中から抜け出していた。どうせ広場へ行ったところで自分の居場所などないのだ。それに、これでセーレンとの約束を破れば、彼も自分にいい加減愛想がつきるだろう。彼のためにも、彼は自分に拘ってはいけない。\r\n　静まりかえった通りは新鮮で、とても心地がよかった。彼はそんな無を楽しみながら、隣街の方へと歩みを進める。道中に、ひとつ車を見つけた。前には老人が眠っているのか微かに上下するのみで少年には気づいていない。しめた、とクノーテンはこっそり荷車に乗り込む。きっと車は遠くまで自分を運んでくれるだろう。途中で寂しくなっても自分でも戻れないどこか知らない土地へ。\r\n　ことことことこと。彼が眠りにつく頃には砂利道に車は揺れていた。\r\n　\r\n　ヒトビトもコレンも、たかが生き物を創り消すだけで目を輝かせる。放たれた水流に豪華な橋を作らせ広場を横断させれば声をあげる。やがてそれは結晶となりチリとなり降り注いだ。夜もその光に満足そうだ。\r\n　「セルミアーデン様、どうぞ。」\r\n　椅子から降りて舞台へとたつ。同時に世界を\"昼\"へと変える。彼らはシン…と静まり返った。現象的に出てくると勝手にヒトビトが勘違いした虹を、ただそれだけで見せてやりながら再び夜へと戻し…ああ、次はどうしようか。\r\n　他のフィアデンと被らなければ、式典での\"御返\"は何をやってもよかった。だから俺は静かに問いかける。\r\n　―なあ、クノーテン。お前は何が見たい？\r\n　そして子供の群れを見る。が、\r\n　「……え？」\r\n　ざわりと、ココロが騒がしくなる。虹は消え、暗雲が立ち込める。影響するように広場もざわつき始めた。\r\n　―どこへ？\r\n　木の影。大人達の隙間。屋敷の中―町中どこを\"見渡して\"も、彼の姿はどこにもない。目を世界中に向けようとすると、アインの声が聞こえた。\r\n　「にーさん…？」\r\n　はっと声のする方に振り向けば、王も怪訝そうな顔をしている。だめだ。頑張ると、決めたじゃないか。暗雲から稲妻を走らせて近場のちょうど空いている、建物と集まる者たちの間へと落とす。いくつか悲鳴が上がった。やがて雲を引き裂くように光の柱を忍ばせる。彼らは―こういうのが好きだと聞いた。\r\n　祭の終わりは早朝。町総出の夜更かし。誰もが目を擦りあくびをしていた。`","export

`　セーレンは屋敷を駆け回る。己の力などはなから信用していない。気配を消すすべなどいくらでもあるし、そうでなくとも彼の存在は、近いゆえに自分にとっては一番認知しにくいのだ。ぱたぱたと、廊下を走っては階段を上がり、壁の外側を透かし見る。そんな慌ただしい子を、王―スフォリアはつまみ上げた。顔を見てようやくその事を知るほど、彼は焦っていた。\r\n　「どうしたのだ。お前ともあろうものが。」\r\n　「クノーテンが…クノーテンが、どこにもいない…」\r\n　「何…？」\r\n　親は子を掴んだまま、従者を呼んだ。\r\n　「クノータデンスを探せ。」\r\n　呼ばれた者はこくりと頷くと現れたときと同様に素早く姿を消した。\r\n　「セーレン、あやつを探すのはよいが、もっと他を使え。ひとつでは難しいこともある。」\r\n　「………」\r\n　少年は解放されると、また慌ただしく駆けていった。\r\n　\r\n　クノーテンが目を覚ますと、車は見知らぬ枯れ地を走っていた。両足を外に出していたが、しかし腰は窪みに沈んでいたため振り落とされてはいない。舵を取る老人も相変わらず気づいていなさそうであった。やがて土地には生気が溢れ、コレンの飛び交う街近辺へ出る。荷物の影から落ちないように覗いてだが、かなり大きな街のようであった。車は門を潜り、道を走り続けひとつの店の前に止まった。クノーテンはその事に気づくと慌てて、しかし気取られないようこっそりと裏道へと逃げ出す。ほっと息をはいて何食わぬ顔して大通りへと戻ると、見たこともないような街路であった。店はこれでもかという装飾で客を呼び込み、ヒトビトとコレンが数多く行き交っている。クノーテンは自分が何をしに来たのかも忘れて踊るようにそこへ混ざっていった。\r\n　\r\n　どこにいる？\r\n　その事だけを考えて、セーレンはいつの間にか草原へと来ていた。もっと町の方へ寄れば、多種の花が咲き誇る人気の花畑に出る。膝下までの背の低い草達の中へしゃがみこむと、苦しそうに頭を抱える。事実、苦しかった。ココロも頭も締め付けられるように、何かが彼に言い聞かせる。それが何をいっているのかはわからないし、わかりたくもない。いつもはそのまま、クノーテンでも話しかけてくれれば、少し休めば痛みはおさまるのだが今回ばかりはそうはいかなかった。ずっと、探し回るときから…いや、式典で彼の姿が見えなかったときから、ずっと苦しいのだ。そんな彼へ、アインが駆けてきた。\r\n　「にーさん、セーレンにーさん。」\r\n　彼はぱたぱたと、セーレンにクノーテンをみていないかと尋ねられて探すのを手伝っていたが、様子のおかしいのに気づいて来たようだ。悲しげな顔でキョウダイを心配する。\r\n　「っ……う……」\r\n　「どうしたの？いたいの？」\r\n　「……………」\r\n　少年はなだめるように、何かで見たのか頭をなでた。\r\n　\r\n　\r\n　――見ツケタッ！！\r\n　\r\n　\r\n　クノーテンがひょいひょいと上機嫌に店々の前を通っていると、少し離れて悲鳴が聞こえた。誰もが音のする方へと振り向いたが、悲鳴は次々と、あちこちから聞こえ、また\"それ\"を目の当たりにするとすぐに街は混乱に包まれる。クノーテンも\"それ\"を視界に捉えて驚愕する。例えば植物の蔓を太くしたもの、しかしそれより遥かに素早く、その先は口のように裂けているのである。地面のあちこちから不規則に生え出てきてはコレンヒトビト建物商品構わず片っ端からむしゃむしゃと食べていた。街には警備の人形もいたが、彼らも何もできずに食べられていく。なんなんだ、あれは。そんな感想しか出てこなかった。\r\n　我に返ると自分へと向けられた矛先に気づき咄嗟に身を屈める。奥にあったショーウィンドウが勢いよく割れ、しかし破片は蔓によって彼へと飛び散るのを防がれる。ほっと息をつく間もなく駆け出し、街の民がそうしているようにクノーテンもその方へ向かった。どちらが安全かなど誰もわからなかったが。\r\n　向かった方にも蔓は出現する。おそらく街から逃げ出せたものはいない。そもそも街から出たところで安全かどうかも謎ではある。逃げもしない建物はもはや半分以上がそれに食われ、街はみるみる痩せこけていく。反対に蔓は食べた分だけ大きくなり、中には二股、三股と足を増やすものまでいた。\r\n　絶望して誰かが座り込んだ。地面から口だけが生えるように飲み込まれ、また別の者が絶望する。クノーテンも何が何やら、ひたすら避けていたが予測不能な地からの出現に足をとられた。\r\n　まずい。\r\n　そんなことを考えるまもなく腕を、体を捕まれて身動きがとれなくなる。しかしすぐには食べられずに、彼を捕らえた蔓は他のいくつかも連れて\"町\"の方へと伸びていった。\r\n　「な、なんだよっ一体…」\r\n　僅かに動く顔を地上へと向ければ、もはや元が何であるかもわからぬ荒れた土地が見えた。\r\n　\r\n　不自然な力の発生は、意外にも近場に大元があった。なぜ今の今まで気づかなかったのかとフィアデンらは町の民を避難させ結界を張る。得意なものが数十と集まってでないと蔓は侵入を容易くしてきた。\r\n　「スフォリア様…」\r\n　「原因は何だ。」\r\n　「それが…よくはわかりません。けれど、フィアデンの張る結界でさえ難なく突破してきます。こんなことができるのは…」\r\n　スフォリアはため息をついた。\r\n　「…確かに、あまり冷静ではなかったからな。しかし、どうしたものか…こういうときに、あれが必要だというのに。」\r\n　スフォリアは対策を練るべく、フィアデンでも位の高い者たちを集める。例え彼ら全員で止めに行ったところで\"彼\"を抑え込むことができるだろうか。集まった者たちは皆不安を表に出していた。\r\n　\r\n　目の前に見えたのは自分を捕らえた蔓をいくつも靡かせる巨大な塔であった。クノーテンはびくりと体を震わせるが、進行が止まることはない。おそらくそこが発生源なのであろう。自分はそこへと連れていかれるのだ。理由は簡単。これらを創り出し操っているのが\"彼\"であるのなら。\r\n　塔へと近づくと周りの蔓が更に少年を囲い、密閉されたところで塔の一部が口を開ける。クノーテンはその中へと乱暴に放り入れられた。叩きつけられた体を起こし、頭を振ればもはや入ってきた口は閉じられていた。\r\n　部屋の中央には光る球が、いくつかの蔓を部屋の天井や壁に張り巡らしている。目を凝らせば、そこには彼が眠っていた。\r\n　「セーレン！」\r\n　クノーテンは片割れを呼ぶ。しかし駆け寄る前に壁から出てきた蔓に胴体貫かれ、先が杭のように曲がると壁へと固定されてしまう。\r\n　「ぐっ…？！」\r\n　じたばたと少しだけ暴れるが取れる気配はない。そればかりか足も腕も絡み取られ本格的に拘束された。\r\n　「クノーテンにーさん！」\r\n　少年のところへ子供が駆けてくる。\r\n　「アイン？！お前、どうして…」\r\n　クノーテンは目を丸くしてキョウダイをみつめた。無事に安堵していいのか、彼も捉えられていることを悩んだ方がいいのか…\r\n　「セーレンにーさんがね…苦しいって…そしたら、地面がお空に来ちゃったの…」\r\n　彼はすすり泣くように手を目へと当てる。\r\n　「そっか…ごめんな、こわいよな。」\r\n　「ううん、あたしはだいじょうぶ。にーさんこそ、いたくないの？」\r\n　「へいきさ、これくらい…」\r\n　クノーテンは上空に存在する球を見つめる。\r\n　「とにかく、あそこまで行かなきゃ。アイン、この蔓取れそうか？」\r\n　「…やってみる。」\r\n　アインの小さな手が蔓を少年のからだから引き剥がそうとする。このセーレンの支配する空間で魔法を使うなど愚かなことだとは、幼い彼にも分かるのだろう。しかしそんなか弱い力では、そこへクノーテンが力を加えても、蔓はぴくりとも動かない。更には、\r\n　「きゃあっ」\r\n　球から伸びた蔓が彼の意識を奪った。\r\n　「アインっ！！…おい、セーレンいい加減にしろよっ！」\r\n　クノーテンが睨んでも、何も反応はなかった。\r\n　「セーレン…？」\r\n　故に本当にこれらが彼の意思で操られているものなのかも不安になる。どうすればいいだろう。きちんと、彼であると証明するには。…彼を止めるには。\r\n　ふとよぎった考えは一か八かの危険なもの。失敗すれば、今まで自分の望んでいた通りになれば、もはや止める術は皆無となる。それでも、それ以上に良いものも思い浮かばずに、透けるように覗いた地面の町の民らを見てしまうと、悠長なことなどいってられなかった。\r\n　「セーレン…お前、なんか…嫌いだ。」\r\n　ぴくり、と球の内部の光に反応があり、次の瞬間にはクノーテンの目の前にそれが来ていた。球に包まれたまま、しっかりと目を開けてセーレンは尋ねる。\r\n　「ドウシテ？どうしテソンなことイウンだ…？」\r\n　「それはこっちの台詞だ。今、お前は何をしている。なぜ私たちを閉じ込めて町を攻撃するんだ。」\r\n　球の中には液体のような光が満ちているのか、少年は浮くように漂っている。\r\n　「キマッてるだろう、おまえたチイガイいらなイカラ。スベテきえテシマエバいい。」\r\n　セーレンはうなだれるようにして下を覗いた。クノーテンもその視線を追うと、そこには不自然な生き物たちがいた。蔓の口から吐き出され、そのままフィアデンらが張っているだろう結界へと向かいそこへ攻撃している。おそらくは先ほど食べられていた街の者たちであろう。\r\n　「っ…ひでえ…何もあいつらにやらせることないだろう？！」\r\n　「クノーテン…そんなこトいワナイデ…俺のコト、スきだよね…？」\r\n　クノーテンは怒りを向けたが、彼にとってはどうでもいいことのように話題を変えられる。\r\n　「クノーテン…」\r\n　「っ……こんなこと、セーレンはしない。お前は…私の知ってるセーレンじゃない！」\r\n　「嫌いにならないで！」\r\n　クノーテンを貫いていた蔓が、彼の中で分裂し暴れ少年は苦悶の表情を作った。\r\n　「クノーテン…ゼッタいに、だれにもワタサない…」\r\n　「ぐ…う、せ、れん…やめ…」\r\n　クノーテンはぐっと唇を噛みしめ、想像で一呼吸つく。球は、再び中央へとゆっくりと戻ろうとしたが、その前にクノーテンが続けた。\r\n　「嫌いだ！セーレンなんか！…っつ…」\r\n　球はぴたりと半端な位置で止まり、少年を蝕む蔓は勢いを増した。\r\n　「あ\"あ\"があ\"ぁッ」\r\n　「……クノーテン、スキデしょ？ホンと、は俺のこと…」\r\n　「んな、わけ…も、やめ…いたぃっ…」\r\n　「あ、ふふ…ソノ表情(カオ)、スゴくいい…」\r\n　振り絞るように開けた視線の先で、少年の瞳は恋慕に浸るようにうっとりと自分を見つめていた。クノーテンは全身に寒気を感じて喘ぎさえも忘れてしまう。\r\n　「セ、レン…？」\r\n　「なに？」\r\n　「おまえ…おか、し…」\r\n　「どこガ…？スキナコのからだ弄りマワセテ、なんで楽しクナイノ？」\r\n　クノーテンは痛みと恐怖に痙攣しながら首を振る。\r\n　「私のこと、嫌いなのか…？」\r\n　「すきだよっだいすき……」\r\n　セーレンは今まで見せたこともないような表情で、頬を少し染めて、ぽつりと続きを述べた。\r\n　\r\n　――愛シテル。\r\n　\r\n　先ほど―ただ身の危険を感じただけの―恐怖とは違う恐ろしさをクノーテンは感じていた。確かに彼からの扱いにはおかしさがあった。けれどそれが明確に言葉にされるとここまでなのか。好きなはずなのに傷つける異常さなどとは比べ物にならない。\r\n　「クノーテン…？どうしたノ？寒イ…？」\r\n　だって…自分達は、双子のキョウダイだろう…？\r\n　「く、来るな…やだ、きもちわる…」\r\n　「エ？」\r\n　セーレンの瞳は歪んでいた。クノーテンには受け入れられぬほど、歪んだ闇を抱えていた。\r\n　――そうだ、きっとこれは本心じゃない。彼も蔓に侵食されて心を蝕まれているのだ。\r\n　「…大丈夫、すぐ、助けてやる、から…」\r\n　「……え？」\r\n　視界がぼやける。意識が遠退いてしまう。それでも、彼を置いて眠ってしまうわけにはいかない。心なしか、今聞こえた声にはいつもの調子が含まれていた気がする。\r\n　「クノーテン…？」\r\n　「…私は、大丈夫だ、から。」\r\n　「嘘だ…お前だけ仲間はずれにされて、くるしかったんだろう…？嫌だったんだろう…？」\r\n　ああ、やっぱり。とクノーテンは息をはく。\r\n　「そっか…それで、おまえ……いいや、大丈夫だ。もう、大丈夫だから、怒るなよ…」\r\n　「…………」\r\n　球が静かに弾けて少年が出てくる。同時にクノーテンを貫いていた蔓は消え、支えるためにセーレンは腕を出した。とさりと小さなからだが小さなからだへと倒れこむ。優しく少年の髪を撫で、次の瞬間には、巨大な塔はもとの草原に戻っていた。\r\n　\r\n　クノーテンが目を覚ますと、そこは大きなベッドの上だった。ふうわりとして、とても心地がいい。こんな暖かさを彼は知らなかった。\r\n　「ッ…！？」\r\n　ぼーっと天井を見つめて回想していたが、すぐに事件に思い当たり勢いよく体を起こす。\r\n　「クノーテン…！」\r\n　側にセーレンが座っていた。\r\n　「ここは…セーレン、無事なのか？アインは…」\r\n　「アインも俺も、もう、平気。すっごくしかられたけど。」\r\n　クノーテンはほっとして一息つく。全身に痛みが走ってもう一度寝転がった。\r\n　「…って、お前を叱っても仕方ないだろ。あれは事故みたいなもんだし。」\r\n　「でも、発端は俺の感情だ。」\r\n　「そりゃま、そうかもしれないけど…」\r\n　ベッドが少し揺れる。軋むような音はしなかったが、セーレンが隣へと乗って来たことがわかった。クノーテンは天井を見つめたまま、あれはただ操られていたに等しいと、疑いもしなかった。目の前に、片割れの顔が正面として現れる。\r\n　「……？」\r\n　彼は自分に覆い被さるような体勢になっていた。\r\n　「どうした？…淋しかったのか？」\r\n　「…うん。いないってわかって、ずっと…ううん、祭の準備で会えないときから、ずっと…」\r\n　ひんやりと、セーレンの髪が直に当たる。そこではじめて、治療のためだろうか―もはや貫かれていた傷は塞がれているが―自分が衣服を纏っていないことに気がつく。セーレンの手が背に回り、彼はきゅっと抱き締めた。そして―\r\n　「っや…」\r\n　少年の手は、適切に\"存在\"へ触れてきた。\r\n　「きもちいい…？」\r\n　びくりと快感に体が揺れ、塞がった傷が悲鳴をあげる。ずぶずぶと、セーレンの腕はクノーテンへと入り込み、弄ばれ彼はそれにどうすることもできずに身をくねらせた。\r\n　「は…なん…こん、なこと…」\r\n　「クノーテン…俺ときもちいいこといっぱいしよう…？」\r\n　少年の瞳が、またあの闇に染まっている。けれども今度は片言でもなければ、自らの体以外は何も使ってはいない。セーレンはクノーテンの顔に自らの顔を近づける。見つめることができないほど近くによって、\r\n　「っ！やめろ、！セーレン…もう…」\r\n　「クノーテン…もっと俺を呼んで…俺だけを見て…」\r\n　「いやだっ」\r\n　クノーテンは精一杯の力でセーレンを突き飛ばす。セーレンは驚いて目を丸くさせ尻餅をついた。\r\n　「なんだよ、お前…変だ、おかしいよ。」\r\n　「…どうして。」\r\n　「だって私たち、双子だろ？こんなの、おかしい…っ」\r\n　全身がまた、痛みに捕らわれ言葉を紡ぐのも辛い。気づいてセーレンが癒そうとするが、キッとクノーテンは彼を睨んだ。\r\n　「やめろ、お前なんかに…治してほしくないっ…きもちわるい…」\r\n　ざわり、とまた彼のココロが揺れる。部屋だったはずのここは、すっかり闇に包まれている。\r\n　「あ…お、おちつけよ、セーレン…」\r\n　「きもち…わるイ……？」\r\n　「う、うそ…ちょっと、驚いて…言い過ぎた…だけで…」\r\n　「ほんトウ…？」\r\n　クノーテンの腕や足を何かが拘束していく。\r\n　「ほんと、ごめんって…だから、怒らないで…」\r\n　「俺のこト、すき…？」\r\n　彼は再び、今度はクノーテンの顔を両手で包むように近づいた。\r\n　「すきっ大好きだから…」\r\n　「愛してくれる？」\r\n　「…っ……それは…」\r\n　その言葉だけは、どうしても例えその場繕いの嘘だとしても口から出すのを憚られた。\r\n　「…ば、ばかだなぁ…好きだからって、必ずしも愛までいくわけじゃないよ。」\r\n　「そっか…クノーテンの\"好き\"はそういう好きなんだな。」\r\n　ふっと、視界に光が戻る。もとの部屋であった。\r\n　「…知ってるよ…おかしいことは。けど、クノーテンなら…わかってくれるって…思ってたんだけどな。」\r\n　セーレンはクノーテンから顔を遠ざける。相変わらず足の方に座って、それ以上に痛みでクノーテンはベッドから降りられなかったが、彼が肩を震わせているのに気がついてその気もなくなった。\r\n　「…セーレン？」\r\n　「だってクノーテン、俺だもん。」\r\n　「何言ってるんだよ。」\r\n　ちらりと横目にセーレンは彼を見つめる。\r\n　「俺だよ。お前は俺で、俺はお前なんだ。だから、俺のこト、わかってくレルデショ…？」\r\n　彼は、憧れのあまりに混同させているのだろうか。それとも比喩的な、飛躍したときの話なのだろうか。\r\n　「ち、違うよ。私たちは双子だけど何もかも一緒な訳じゃない。一緒じゃなくたっていいんだ。なあ、もっと自分を大事にしろよ。」\r\n　いつもそうなのだ。目の前の少年は、自分の望みばかりを気にして…\r\n　「嫌いだよ、クノーテンなんか。わがままだし、迷惑ばかりだし、本当にしたいことはできてないし…」\r\n　「セーレン…」\r\n　「でも、…好きなんだ。嫌いとは違う意味の\"好き\"。俺で一杯にしたい、好き。」\r\n　「それは…私に向けるべきじゃない。」\r\n　セーレンは顔を目の向きに合わせ口を開けた。哀しそうな瞳で、何かを訴えようとしていた。\r\n　戸が開いてスフォリアが入ってきた。セーレンは王を睨んだが、開けた口を静かに閉じるに留めた。\r\n　―どこかで失意に陥る自分がいた。`","export

「全く…何をしているのだお前たちは。」\r\n　スフォリアの蔑むような瞳に背景が現実になった。布団の上ははひどく乱れ、セーレンはクノーテンの脚にのっかったまま。急に恥ずかしくなってクノーテンはいそいで彼をどけ掛け布団の中へと潜り込んだ。\r\n　「そ、その…これは…」\r\n　「そもそもどうしてお前がここにいる。…セーレン、私は部屋に戻せと命じたはずだが？」\r\n　「…連れてきた。欲しかったから。」\r\n　スフォリアはわざとらしく大きなため息をついた。\r\n　「今回の件でよくわかった。私はお前を甘やかしすぎていたのだな。」\r\n　王は立っている子へと向き直ると今までとは逆に彼らを扱った。\r\n　「出ていきなさい。私はクノーテンに話がある。」\r\n　「「え…」」\r\n　双子は声を重ねる。喜びと驚きの割合まで同じであった。せかす親の言葉にセーレンは素直に従った。\r\n　「本当にお前のこととなるとあの子は素直だな。」\r\n　「はは…」\r\n　「さて、どこまで覚えている。」\r\n　スフォリアが手をかざすと、残りの傷は次第に消えていった。クノーテンは傷口のあったところを擦って何ともないことを確認する。\r\n　「ええと…セーレンが暴走して、怒らないで欲しいって願ったことかな。」\r\n　「よい。…暴走の止め方は分かっているのだな。」\r\n　え…？とクノーテンは眉を寄せる。原因ではなくどうして止め方を重要視したのだろう。\r\n　「…私が本当にやめてほしいことが分かれば止まる、けど…」\r\n　「けど？」\r\n　「あいつ…たまに話を聞かなくなるというか…よくわからないことを呟いてる。」\r\n　「あの子はなんと？」\r\n　「……私を、その…好きだと。」\r\n　「…いつも通りだろう。お前はあの子の気に入りのようだからな。」\r\n　違う。\r\n　ぎりと歯を噛みしめた。無論この説明ではそう取るのが当たり前であろう。よもや、欲望的な好意だとは思うまい。クノーテンにもそれはわかっていたが、どこかで違うと思っていたかった。\r\n　「…やめろ、って言うだけじゃ止まんないよ。」\r\n　「理解させられれば止まるだろう？なら、問題はないな。ついてこい。」\r\n　スフォリアは踵を返すと部屋を出ていった。連れていきたいなら転移すればいいのにと、クノーテンは不思議に思いながら後を追った。\r\n　\r\n　屋敷の玄関から真正面にある階段に隠れるようにして部屋があった。そこから更に棚をこえ、鏡をこえ、薄暗い廊下に出た。闇に石道と階段とだけが存在しているような質素な空間だった。スフォリアはあれ以上なにも説明しないまま、黙って階段を降りていく。このように隠された部屋に自分が来ていいものかとクノーテンは辺りを見渡した。こつこつと足音が響く。声なんか出したらこだまして何十にも重なってしまうのだろう。階段はどこまでも下っていく。\r\n　そこは終わりだと気づくには狭すぎた。階段の内の一段よりほんの少し広いスペースに重そうな見た目の扉がつけられている。スフォリアが前へ立てば勝手に戸は光を漏らした。\r\n　「お待ちしておりました。」\r\n　さて出迎えたのは誰であったか。見たことがある。おそらく王の側近の部下だろう。クノーテンは頭を上げたフィアデンを仰ぎ見る。彼は視線に気づくと冷ややかな視線を少年へと向けた。\r\n　「やれ。」\r\n　「は。」\r\n　スフォリアが短く告げる。状況がわからずに笑みさえ浮かべるクノーテンの首を何かが捕らえた。引き寄せられて始めて頑丈な縄状の物に繋がれたことがわかった。\r\n　「けほ…な、なに？」\r\n　顔をあげれば従者が腕を伸ばし、スフォリアはこちらに背を向けていた。\r\n　「ま…って…」\r\n　首を壁へと引き寄せられて声はうまく出ない。魔法を使おうにも集中できなければクノーテンの魔法程度は従者でも打ち消せる。\r\n　「どうします？」\r\n　「構わん、予定通りに始めろ。」\r\n　冷たい声が部屋に響く。戸から出ていこうとするスフォリアを、クノーテンは腕を伸ばして止めようとした。\r\n　「まって…と、さん…ッ？！」\r\n　が、その単語を口にした途端に全身を何かが巡って体を痙攣させた。倒れこんだ後に頭を踏みつけたのは従者だった。\r\n　「あの方はお前などの親ではない。二度とそう呼ぶなよ。」\r\n　「…ぇ…？」\r\n　視界が歪む。物理的な痛みというよりは気持ち悪さに近いのかもしれない。衝撃ではなく魔法による精神攻撃であったのだ。クノーテンは息を整えるとできる限り顔を動かして扉の方を見つめた。そこにはもう、彼の姿はなかった。\r\n　\r\n　「何度言えばわかるのだ！」\r\n　「がっ…」\r\n　従者は少年の顎を蹴飛ばすと、魔法を発動する。\r\n　「うああぁあぁっ！！」\r\n　クノーテンは頭を抱えると床へ肘をつけて体を丸めた。\r\n　「いたぃいいやめてぇええ！！」\r\n　瞳には涙を浮かべ上目遣いに青年を見つめたが、彼は同情も示さずに嘲笑した。\r\n　「わかったか！今までが異常だったのだ。お前は道具に過ぎぬっ！」\r\n　「やだっやめてっ…くるしぃよおっ」\r\n　じたばたと苦痛から逃れるべく床へ足やら手やらを叩きつける。そんな少年に従者は魔法をといた。\r\n　「はー…はー……」\r\n　「お前は何だ。」\r\n　クノーテンは息を震わせるだけで何も言わない。青年はそんな彼を掴みあげると問いを続ける。\r\n　「お前は何だ？」\r\n　「……わたし、は…」\r\n　顔を動かせぬままにちらと瞳だけで青年を伺う。彼は相変わらず冷ややかな視線を向けていた。\r\n　「…と、さんは…？どうして、私にこんな…」\r\n　「\"とうさん\"…？」\r\n　従者は掴んでいた手を離す。魔法も使えずにクノーテンは床に叩きつけられた。\r\n　「うっ…」\r\n　「それは、誰のことだ？」\r\n　「……？」\r\n　「よもや、スフォリア様ではあるまい…？」\r\n　クノーテンは従者を見上げた。彼はそれまでにない怒りの表情を見せていた。恐ろしくなって少年は力を振り絞って距離をとる。\r\n　「答えろ。」\r\n　「……さっき、とうさんは…傷、治してくれた…のに…」\r\n　「スフォリア様と呼べッ」\r\n　ピンと指を張った腕がクノーテンに向けられると彼はまた床をのたうち回った。意味を持たぬ声だけが体から軋むように出て、しかし青年は力を緩めることもせず腕を伸ばしたままであった。\r\n　「ああぁっうああぁあ」\r\n　「苦しいか？けれどお前が悪い。スフォリア様は偉大なお方。お前が共にあれたあの日々は幸福と知れ！」\r\n　―幸福？\r\n　クノーテンは薄れゆく意識の中で言葉の意味を考えた。あの日々が、自分だけが異物のように扱われていたあの生活が…？\r\n　従者の術は一息を吐くと同時に途切れ、クノーテンもまた反り上がっていた身体を地にぶつける。\r\n　「………」\r\n　「さて、私も他の用事があるからな。今日はこれまでだ。」\r\n　彼は扉の前まで姿勢良く歩いていくと思い出したように付け加えた。\r\n　「…賢くなれ。己が役割を理解しろ。」\r\n　扉は音もたてずに現れ、従者と共に消えていった。\r\n　\r\n　「クノーテンは？」\r\n　スフォリアが\"地上\"へと戻るなりセーレンは彼のもとへとやって来た。\r\n　彼は不安そうに親を見上げる。\r\n　「…わからぬか？」\r\n　「………この辺なのはわかる、けど。」\r\n　「心配するな。私の目の届くところにいる。」\r\n　スフォリアはセーレンに来いと手招きする。しかし駄々をこねるようにその場にとどまるセーレンに王はこう脅した。\r\n　「クノーテンに危害を加えられたくなければ言うことを聞け。」\r\n　そこにアインや民と接するあの優しい顔はもうなかった。\r\n　\r\n　従者は確か…\"今日は\"と言っていた。\r\n　それはつまり、少なくともあと一度は来ると言うことを意味している。おそらく、あの苦痛と共に。\r\n　クノーテンはできるだけ楽な姿勢となるよう無理矢理手足を動かした。傷を負っているわけではないのにどうしてかそれらは思う通りに動いてくれない。まるで錆び付いた歯車のようにそれがなんであったかを忘れているようだった。\r\n　「なんで…いきなし…」\r\n　きっかけと考えられるのは、セーレンの暴走。彼は自分を嫌うものへ敵意を見せることはあれど、あそこまで明確に他を傷つけることは今までなかったのだ。おそらく彼自身がその幼い体に秘める力に耐えられなくなってきたためであろう。間違いなくセーレンの能力はここ数日で進化していた。\r\n　しかし。それと自分がこんな仕打ちを受けることにどんな繋がりがあるのだ。むしろ、彼の暴走を催促してしまう…\r\n　―それが目的か？世界をどうのと綺麗な言葉を並べておいて、破壊こそがフィアデンの悲願なのだろうか。それともただの嫉妬か。考えてみればスフォリアがわざわざ足でここまでつれてきたのは、何か別の\"術\"に集中していたためではないか？おそらく隠匿系。彼ほどのものがそのような状況までとなるなら対象はセーレンだろう。彼から自分の所在を隠すために。\r\n　クノーテンは目を瞑る。考えても何もわからない。隠すだけなら放っておいてほしい。自分はそれで十分なのだ。その方がいい。苦しいのは…好きではない。自室に閉じ込められたときすぐに自分を失えたのは、苦しみがなかったから。苦痛は逃げの引き金になり得るが、少年にとっては何よりも自分の存在を意識させるものだった。\r\n　ふたたび目を開けたとき視界は歪んでいた。雨が降ったときの窓のように。\r\n　クノーテンの中にはひとつ、育っていくものがある。彼自身もそれを感じていた。ただただ、それだけが形を成してゆく。\r\n　―だって全部、セーレンが居なければ起こり得なかったことだものな。\r\n　\r\n　従者は眠る少年を文字通りたたき起こすと昨日の質問の答えをいえと彼の頭を踏みつけた。起きたばかりで整理のつかないクノーテンは聞き返した。\r\n　「だから、お前がなんであるかはわかったのか？」\r\n　「じぶん…？」\r\n　そういえば、そんな話があったかな。痛みから逃げたいので頭が一杯で微塵も考えようとは思わなかった。はあ、と青年はため息をつく。\r\n　「…わかった。お前は察しが悪いのだな。これからははっきり言うようにする。」\r\n　足裏で支えていた頭を軽くこづくとクノーテンに起き上がれと顎で指示する。\r\n　「えっと…」\r\n　「いいか。お前は道具だ。」\r\n　それは、昨日も聞いた言葉だ。クノーテンは落ち着いた様子で静かに首を振る。\r\n　「フィアデンだって…認めたくなくてもいいけど、私は物じゃない。」\r\n　「違うな。お前は端から生物…ましてやフィアデンとしては創られていない。」\r\n　は…？とクノーテンは声もなく首を傾ける。\r\n　「お前がセルミアーデン様の双子として\"扱われていた\"理由…それはお前があの子の『制御装置』であるからだ。」\r\n　「へ？…なに？どういうこと？？」\r\n　「全く…なぜ最初からこうしなかったのだろうか…」\r\n　混乱するクノーテンをよそに従者は独り言を呟く。\r\n　「あんた…おかしいんじゃないのか？だって私は…」\r\n　「今まではセルミアーデン様のわがままを聞いて\"ただのキョウダイ\"としてフィアデンでは扱われていたが…お前は本来ヒトビトやコレンよりも劣る存在。ただの道具なのだ。」\r\n　青年の瞳は今までの無情な彼とは違って哀れみのような嫌悪のような光を灯している。クノーテンにはただ騙すための嘘とは思えなかった。\r\n　「嘘だ…だって、いつも私はあいつの…っ」\r\n　嘘と思いたかったのに。彼はあまりにも、素直で王を敬愛する無害なフィアデンに思えてならなかったのだ。\r\n　「やだっ…セーレンの、ための道具なんて…」\r\n　「…今までの扱いなど、やっぱりなかった方がよかったよな…？けど、これは事実で、もう我々はそういう方針で行くと決めたのだ。」\r\n　「…きっかけは…あいつの暴走？」\r\n　「よくわかってるじゃないか。残念だったな。セルミアーデン様がもう少し大人しくしていればお前は…いや、こんな話しは無駄だな。」\r\n　青年は気を張るようにクノーテンを睨み直すと続けた。\r\n　「お前の機能はただひとつ…スフォリア様に忠実になれ。あとはあのお方がうまく扱ってくださる。」\r\n　クノーテンはぐっと唇を噛み締めると思い切り首を振った。\r\n　「だったら連れてきてよ！とうさんから、きちんと…」\r\n　しかし言い終わる前に首輪が彼の言葉を塞き止めた。\r\n　「ふぐっ…」\r\n　「スフォリア様とよべ。お前が子として扱われていた期間は終わったのだ。」\r\n　青年が指した指を下ろせば首もとの光と共に苦しみは引いていく。クノーテンは息を整えたが目からはぽろぽろと滴が落ちた。\r\n　「これからはあのお方を親と呼ぶことは許されぬ。」\r\n　「やだよ…だって、やっと目を合わせて…くれたのに…」\r\n　彼は祈るような思いで従者を見上げた。もはやそこに先程の憐れみは存在していなかったが。\r\n　「それは…それこそが、お前が『お前』として認められる証だろう。仮初めの役であるキョウダイではなく。」\r\n　「……」\r\n　「よかったじゃないか。もうお前はおまけじゃない。それが嫌だったのだろう？スフォリア様は全て知っておられる。」\r\n　少年は縮こまるように手足を引っ込める。何も了承していないその仕草に従者は腕を伸ばした。反射的にクノーテンは肩を跳ねさせる。青年が笑った。なんだ、順調じゃないか。\r\n　「…もう術は受けたくないだろ？」\r\n　「…え？」\r\n　「別に私はお前をただ苦しめたいわけではない。お前が本来の役割に反するから、それを正すよう命を受けているだけだ。」\r\n　そう言葉をかけたが、伸ばしたままの腕では、少年は緊張を解けない。\r\n　「いいな、これからはスフォリア様とお呼びしろ。そして決して逆らうな。」\r\n　従者は指を差すでなくぱちりと指をならす。みるみるクノーテンは目を開いていく。\r\n　まるで…まるで言葉が自分の中へ許可なく入り込んでいくようであった。\r\n　\r\n　「クノーテンは…無事なんだろうな。」\r\n　陣の上から降りるなりセーレンは問いかける。\r\n　「全く…修行終わりの開口一番があれのことか。」\r\n　「答えろよ。」\r\n　「問題ない。」\r\n　セーレンはふうと息をはいて段へと腰かける。修行には中々精神を使っているはずなのだ。倒れたとしても無理はない。\r\n　「大丈夫か。」\r\n　スフォリアはできるだけ微笑んで気遣うがすぐに切り捨てられる。\r\n　「俺は平気だ。」\r\n　「…ふむ、今日は無理をしすぎにも思えたが。」\r\n　「セルミアーデン様。」\r\n　親子のもとへやって来たのは先程から装置をいじっていた従者の一人であった。彼は陣を消すとスフォリアに一礼する。\r\n　「無茶をしては困ります。我々が抑えられる範囲でやっていただかないと…」\r\n　「セーレン。」\r\n　呼ばれて少年は反対を向く。\r\n　「…いいだろ、暴走しなかったんだから。」\r\n　「それは結果の話だ。お前の力は…」\r\n　「世界に届くんだろ。わかってるよ。」\r\n　セーレンはやろうと思えば世界のあらゆることを支配できる力を持っている。しかしそれはあくまで力を思うままに扱えるならの話。今はまだ幼い彼では完全に制御しきれず些細な感情や少しの無理で彼は侵食されてしまう。\r\n　以前のような街を巻き込む規模の暴走こそしなかったものの、しばしば苦しがり心を侵犯され周囲の空間をねじ曲げる。修行とはつまりは力が制御できるようにという慣らしであった。\r\n　部屋へと戻っていく子を見つめ、スフォリアは次の仕事―暴走の後処理へと赴いた。\r\n　\r\n　「…スフォリア様、の命令は…絶対…」\r\n　誰もいなくなった簡素な空間でクノーテンはぽそりと呟く。身体中をその言葉が巡りつい口から出てしまったのだ。とはいえそれで抜けるでなく、音となり再び聴覚から吸収されていく。ぐ…と腕に力を入れて起き上がり、こんなことではいけないと首を振り思い描いたのはキョウダイであった。\r\n　そういえばアインとはしばらくあってないかな。\r\n　もともと彼とは毎日顔を合わせていたわけではなかったが決して仲が悪いわけではない。明らかにセーレンと一緒にいることが多いというだけでクノーテンはアインのことも可愛がっていたし、アインもまた双子を差別しなかった。そうだ、とうさんにとって自分はできそこないなのだ。だからそうして何かの理由をつけて処理しようとしているだけ。はじめから決まっていた訳じゃない。そう言えば、私が納得すると…命令に忠実な彼だって騙されているのかもしれない。彼がたとえ本気で思っていようとそれが真実だなんてわからないではないか。\r\n　クノーテンはもう一度腕に力をいれる。はじめから…道具として創られたなど…やはりおかしい。別に根拠はなかった。願望に等しい。そう考えないと…ひどく自分が憐れだった。\r\n　\r\n　「あ、おとーさんっ」\r\n　アインは顔をあげるとてこてこと駆けていく。付き人がお辞儀をした。\r\n　「まだおしごと？」\r\n　「終わって帰ってきたところだ。」\r\n　「じゃあ遊べるね。」\r\n　にこりと微笑む子へ王は同じ顔で返すとしかしすぐに申し訳なさそうに眉をさげる。\r\n　「いや、次のがあるからな。」\r\n　「アインフォリアム様？スフォリア様はお忙しいのです。お相手なら私がいたしますので。」\r\n　付き人は頭をあげずにそう告げ、アインの方が気をつかって なおってほしいと背を叩いた。スフォリアは愛し子が手を振るのに返すとそのまま地下へと向かう。無論そこにいるのは…\r\n　「進捗は」\r\n　「スフォリア様。」\r\n　「あ…」\r\n　クノーテンは虚ろな瞳で見上げる。王はそんな少年を睨み付けると従者が状態をのべた。\r\n　「申し訳ありません。少し、手間取ってまして…」\r\n　「よい。そんなにすぐにできるとは思っていない。」\r\n　クノーテンはふらふらと立ち上がると彼らを睨んだ。\r\n　「…私は、道具なんかじゃない…」\r\n　「……ここまでか。」\r\n　スフォリアは腰をおとし真っ直ぐに少年の目を見つめた。精一杯抗おうと奥底に光が見える。\r\n　「だってほら…とうさんは、もう…私の目を、見てくれるじゃないか。」\r\n　「スフォリア様とお呼びしろ。」\r\n　クノーテンがたどたどしく―苦しみでふらつくという方面で―言葉を紡ぐと従者が訂正をいれる。\r\n　「そうだな…ようやく\"お前\"と向き合おうとしたからだろう。」\r\n　なら、と一歩前へ出るのを王は頭を撫でるように押さえて首を振る。\r\n　「お前はフィアデンでも、それ以外の生命でもない。」\r\n　「違う！私はフィアデンだ…セーレンやアインのキョウダイであんたの子供だろう？！」\r\n　「いいや。それは今までの\"お前\"でない『クノータデンス』だ。そうだな…これからは分かりやすく名前も変えよう。」\r\n　スフォリアは考えるように間を開ける。クノーテンはそんな彼の袖をぐっと握った。従者が反応したが王が構わないとそのままにさせる。\r\n　「…制御装置『ツェルクーペ』。」\r\n　「嫌だ。私はクノータデンスだ…！」\r\n　袖をつかんだまま首をふるクノーテンの腕を掬うように掴むとスフォリアは瞳を光らせる。捕まれた腕から刺激が直に伝わって…\r\n　「＊＃∥％＆～￣￣＼＠…／＼※？！」\r\n　クノーテンは振りほどいて頭を抱えると苦しみとも呼べぬ衝撃にのたうち回る。\r\n　「…よいな、我に従え。」\r\n　王は見下すごとく立ち上がると少年を見据える。じたばたと床を蹴飛ばしていたがやがて動作は静まった。\r\n　「はい…す…フォリア…さま…」\r\n　クノーテンは虹彩を大小に揺らしながらそう呟いた。\r\n　「また、しばらく任せるぞ。」\r\n　「ありがとうございます。」\r\n　\r\n　王の退席を悟ってから従者は面を上げる。さて、と振り向けば涙を流すことを忘れたのか目一杯に溜め込んだ少年がいた。\r\n　「ふ…スフォリア様の魔法は凄まじいだろう？私なんかとは比べ物にならぬほど…」\r\n　「……」\r\n　「…ふん、暫くは何も感じられぬか。」\r\n　場に無言が続くと、やがて従者は扉を開け出ていった。\r\n　クノーテンが寒さを感じたのはそれからしばらくしてのことだった。おそらく夜も更けているのだろう。ようやく起き上がると彼は天井を見上げる。今まで気づかなかったが、天井はずいぶんと高かった。もしかしたら上の地面はほぼ地上に等しいのかもしれない。暗がりで明確に底を見ることができない。\r\n　けれども、とてもではないが壁を上る気力はない。座っているのも嫌なくらいだ。\r\n　―私だって魔法は使える。こうして何も与えられなくても\"シヌ\"ことはない。それなのに…\r\n　それなのに大人は誰も、彼をフィアデンであると認めてはくれないのだ。\r\n　「なんでだよ…」\r\n　どうして、セーレンばかり……不思議と憎しみは半身へ向けられる。\"何の罪もありはしないのに…\"\r\n　\r\n　それからそう日はたたなかった。\r\n　苦悶の表情で何事も発しなかったクノーテンは、青年が腕を下げてももはや安堵も示さなかった。\r\n　「ツェルクーペ。」\r\n　「…はい。」\r\n　クノーテンは面をあげぬままに返事をする。\r\n　「お前の所有者はだれだ？」\r\n　「スフォリア様です。」\r\n　「よし、正常だな。」\r\n　従者が呟くと扉を透けてスフォリアが現れる。\r\n　クノーテンはそれを認めると真っ直ぐに彼を見つめた。\r\n　「スフォリア様。ツェルクーペの調子は上々です。すぐにでも実践可能かと。」\r\n　「よくやった。」\r\n　従者は少しだけ照れたが首をふると敬愛の眼差しを王へと向ける。\r\n　「スフォリア様が魔法を使ってくださってから調子が良くなりましたから。」\r\n　彼はそんな従者の様子に苦笑いするとクノーテンへと向き直り手をさしのべた。\r\n　「さて、これからお前にも働いてもらう。己の役割はわかっているな？」\r\n　「…はい。」\r\n　「…私が憎いか？」\r\n　「いいえ。」\r\n　親であったはずの者の質問に少年は淡々と答えていたが、それがただのその場しのぎではないことはスフォリアが何の脈絡もなしに彼へ苦を与えようと悲鳴ひとつあげなかったことで明らかであった。\r\n　「苦しかったか？」\r\n　「スフォリア様に必要ならば構いません。」\r\n　「お前は…？」\r\n　「私はツェルクーペ。セルミアーデンの制御装置です。スフォリア様の命令は絶対…」\r\n　王はもう一度従者へ向き、改めて賛辞を述べた。\r\n　「では行こう。」\r\n　スフォリアは歩き出す。案外彼は慎重である。ひとときの喜びで隠しを忘れるような事はなかった。\r\n　\r\n　「！…クノーテン？！」\r\n　いち早く気配に気づきセーレンは地上へ上がった彼らの前へと現れた。\r\n　「大丈夫だったか？変なことされてないか？」\r\n　そして王や従者に見向きもせずに彼へとかけより肩に手をおいた。\r\n　しかしその相手は顔を伏せたまま、何の反応も示さない。不思議がってセーレンは顔を覗こうと屈もうとする。\r\n　「セーレン。」\r\n　そんな彼をスフォリアが制止する。\r\n　「もはやそれはお前のキョウダイではない。」\r\n　「は？」\r\n　「そうだろう？ツェルクーペ。」\r\n　何のことやらと首を捻るセーレンにクノーテンは先程からの調子で告げる。\r\n　「…セルミアーデン…私はあなたを制御するための道具だ。」\r\n　ぴくりとセーレンの髪先が浮いたと思った頃には彼はスフォリアを\"持ち上げて\"いた。焦ったのは従者だけであった。\r\n　「クノーテンに何をした。」\r\n　「フ……ツェル、クーペ。」\r\n　詰め寄るセーレンに怯みもせず彼は余裕の表情でクノーテンを見つめる。\r\n　「やめて、セーレン。」\r\n　「っクノーテン！？」\r\n　「やめて。」\r\n　クノーテンは口以外動かなかった。\r\n　「なんでだよ？おまえだって嫌いだろ？こんな奴…」\r\n　セーレンはスフォリアを魔法で拘束したままそちらには背を向けて、俯くクノーテンの頬へと触れる。そうしてそのまま、顔を上げるように力を入れて…\r\n　「「？！」」\r\n　今度はクノーテン以外の誰もが驚く番であった。\r\n　少年は彼を認めるなり目を見開くとすぐに腕を手前、セーレンの胸の辺りへ手のひらが来るように張った。次の瞬間にはセーレンが苦痛の表情を見せスフォリアは解放される。\r\n　「お、まえだ…おまえなんかが…いる…から…っ」\r\n　クノーテンは震えながら魔法を持続させる。\r\n　「クノー…テン？」\r\n　「やめなさい、ツェルクーペ。」\r\n　すかさず王は指令を飛ばすが、今までのことは演技であったかのように言うことを聞かない。\r\n　「うるさい！うるさいうるさいうるさい！！」\r\n　「おい、貴様何をやってるのか」\r\n　「嫌いだ！いやだいやだいやだいやだ！！」\r\n　無論セーレンがすぐにほどこうとすれば簡単にクノーテンから逃れることはできたであろう。しかし彼は\"言いたいこと\"を汲み取ると口を三日月のように歪めた。\r\n　「ふふ…あはは…そうだよ、クノーテン…それでいいんだ…」\r\n　「うるさい、黙れ。消えろ！お前なんか…」\r\n　「あっははは！ようやくわかったんだね！そうだよ、その感情だ…もっと俺に見せて。俺に向けて…」\r\n　まるで成り立たぬ二つの会話をスフォリアはクノーテンへ攻撃することでやめさせる。睨んだのはセーレンだった。\r\n　「う…あぁ…う\"ああっ」\r\n　「おい。何をする…せっかくクノーテンが…」\r\n　「訳のわからぬことを。…まだ早かったか。」\r\n　クノーテンはまた瞳に溢れんばかりの涙をためてのたうち回る。セーレンが彼を宥めようと駆け寄って、しかし従者に距離をとらせられる。\r\n　「邪魔をするなっ」\r\n　「やめ…いや、セーレン…」\r\n　振り向いて敵意を表したセーレンを止めたのは、そんな彼の悲鳴だった。\r\n　「いや…これ、いじょう…くるし、の…いや…」\r\n　「！…クノーテンっ」\r\n　「さあ、セルミアーデン。牙を納めろ。これが壊れてほしくないならな。」\r\n　「くっ…」\r\n　ぱしりと拘束だけ振り払うと少年は抵抗をやめた。\r\n　「……」\r\n　「良い子だ…そうだ、お前がそうしていれば、これに酷いことはしない。」\r\n　クノーテンはぷつりと糸が途切れた人形のように動きを止める。\r\n　「クノーテン…ごめん…」\r\n　「連れていけ。」\r\n　セーレンは押されるままにふらふらと、自室へと帰っていった。`","export

`　「いや！！ごめんなさいごめんなさいごめんなさい…」\r\n　「まったく…まさかセルミアーデン様に危害を加えようとするとは…」\r\n　「…私への服従だけしか定義していなかったからな。それ以上の憎しみで別の動作をしたようだ。」\r\n　再び地下の牢獄へと連れてこられたクノーテンは自らの手足を引っ張って謝罪を続けた。\r\n　「ごめんなさいもうしませんスフォリア様には逆らいません…！」\r\n　「そうだな、セーレンへの接触に関しても幾らか決めておく必要がありそうだ。」\r\n　しかしそれらの言葉は聞きもせずに王と従者は会議を進める。\r\n　「では、セルミアーデン様には手を出さないこと。しかしセルミアーデン様の言葉には従わないこと…あとは助けを求めないこと、くらいでしょうか。」\r\n　「止めるときはあのやり方のままで良い。それを考慮してできそうか？」\r\n　「やります。あなたの望みが叶うように…全力を尽くします。」\r\n　王は頷くとクノーテンにかけていた魔法を解く。彼はその場にぐったりと静まった。\r\n　\r\n　豪勢な部屋のおおきなベッドで少年は回想していた。顔は火照り自らを抱き締めるように震えている。瞳には闇が渦巻いている。\r\n　「うふふ…クノーテン…ふふっ…」\r\n　彼は嬉しくてたまらなかった。やはり彼は、彼だけはきちんと自分をわかってくれたのだと感じられたから。他の誰に否定されようと誤解されようと、彼がわかってくれれば他にはなにも要らない。彼にとって世界など、彼といられる単なる空間でしかなかったのだ。そんなものはいくらでも創れる。\r\n　「待っててね…すぐに迎えにいってあげるから…」\r\n　セーレンとて自らを制御しきれていないことはわかっていた。だからこそ必要なのだ。今は、王に従うことがまだ。\r\n　\r\n　青年は決定事項を順に繰り返す。\r\n　「セルミアーデンには手を出すな。言葉に耳を貸すな。助けをこうな。」\r\n　クノーテンは暴れることも忘れて目を見開いたままそれを聞いていた。以前からそうだが、彼の思考は止まっているわけではない。それよりもたち悪く、無理矢理やりたいことにすり替えられているのだ。クノーテンはもはや、心の底からスフォリアへの服従を望んでいた。彼らのかける魔法が、放心を許さなかった。\r\n　苦しいのは嫌だし、意識を手放すこともできない。\r\n　スフォリアに従っていれば苦しくない。セーレンを止めることだけが自分の存在価値。そうだ…だから…\r\n　「ふう…」\r\n　従者は魔法を解くと息を吐いた。\r\n　「…だから、セーレンが…」\r\n　「うん？」\r\n　「セルミアーデンが能力を意のままにできるようになったら…私は不要だ…スフォリア様から見放される…」\r\n　青年は疲れたような、呆れたような顔で伸びをすると相手をした。\r\n　「それは何よりもの幸福だろう？あのお方の望みのままにお前はいられるのだから。」\r\n　「…はい。」\r\n　「けどまあ、すぐにはそうもいかないだろう。力を我が物としたセルミアーデン様が大人しくフィアデンのために尽くすとは思えない。…スフォリア様の見解では、あの子はお前に何をされようとお前を手放すことはしないらしいからな。」\r\n　彼は、その後は独り言のように、現に先程も破壊の術をかけられても喜んでいたし…と気味悪がった。\r\n　そんな風に震えた従者を見て確かに、とクノーテンは同意する。どうして彼はそうまでして\"自分\"を求めるのか。好かれようとするのか。仲は良い方だっただろう。双子という特別性もある。しかしそれにしては異常だ。むしろより近いものほど次第に嫌悪の対象になるだろうに。\r\n　一息ついた従者は別の仕事へと上っていった。\r\n　彼はたしか…自分を愛しているのだと告げた。あのときは暴走によって歪められたものだろうと思っていたが…もしかして、\r\n　「いや…そん、なこと…は…」\r\n　スフォリアが部屋へと入ってくる前、彼にされた行為と言葉を思い出す。色々ありすぎてすっかり忘れていたのだが…\r\n　クノーテンは自分の中を巡る言葉に耳を傾ける。その方が、遥かにましだった。\r\n　\r\n　瞳を開ければ、自分の部屋であった。閉じこめられていたためか、今さらその狭さに喫驚する。\r\n　辺りを見回す。今身体を置いている布団と、紙などが少し散らばった机に、壁に等しい本棚。なにも変わらぬ風景に違和感を持てなかった。\r\n　「クノーテン。」\r\n　扉の枠の奥にセーレンが微笑んでいた。\r\n　「クノーテンにーさん。」\r\n　隣からひょっこりとアインが顔を出す。\r\n　「祭りだよ、行こう。」\r\n　クノーテンは頷くと差し出された手を握った。外はざわざわと賑やかで、しかし今までに感じたことがないほど暖かだった。\r\n　「どうかしたのか？」\r\n　「クノーテンにーさん…泣いてるの？」\r\n　セーレンとアインが両側から覗いてくる。少年は言われてそうなのかと確認するために手を顔へと当てた。濡れた感触が、彼を現実へと戻した。\r\n　どこまでも延びる天井のある冷たい部屋に転がっていた。眠っていたのだろう。ずっと、あの世界にいたいのに、それは魔法によって叶うはずのないものへとなってしまった。彼は起き上がらずにそのまま、従者が来るのを待った。何も命令されぬ人形が床に転がるように、自分の意思は捨ててじっとしていた。すぐに彼はやって来るものだと思っていた。しかし待てども―その場所では昼夜の区別はつかないが―おそらく2、３日やってはこなかった。\r\n　さすがに寝転がるのに疲れて1日がたつより早くクノーテンは身体を起こすだけはした。\r\n　数日たてば身体を巡っていた言葉も意味だけ残して薄れていった。彼に残っていたのは不快な記憶のみ。たまらなくなって―いけないことだと感じながら―少年は扉を開ける。意外にもそれは容易く階段を見せた。\r\n　見上げても見きれぬほど階段は続いている。けれども考えてみれば…別にここを出るなとは言われなかった。そっと一段目に足をのせてみた。\r\n　コツコツと静寂に響く様を楽しみながら進めば徐々に床が見えてくる。クノーテンは頭に迫りきる前にそっと、扉を透けさせる。空は茜に染まっていた。きょろきょろと外を見回す。辺りには誰もいないようであった。ひとまず従者を探すべきだと直感が告げて彼は屋敷へと入っていく。けれども屋敷にも、青年はおろか誰一つとしていない。仕方がないと今度は町の方へと向かっていった。\r\n　町の方はいつも通りであった。ヒトビトは仕事をしていたし、コレンが飛び交い、子供たちは駆け回っていた。少年は少し前までよく遊んでいた子らに声をかけた。\r\n　「なあ、フィアデンはどこにいったんだ？」\r\n　「はー？」\r\n　少し距離のあった子供らは尋ねられると遊びを中断し彼のもとへ寄ってきた。\r\n　「なんだ？」\r\n　「フィアデンが見当たらないんだけど…」\r\n　「あー…願いもの？だめだめ、今フィアデン様たちは大切な儀式中なんだから。」\r\n　「え？」\r\n　子供らはねーっと顔を見合わせた。しかしクノーテンが驚いたのはフィアデンのやっていることではなかった。\r\n　願いもの―フィアデンのもとへ頼みごとをしにくる旅のヒトビトやコレンをそう呼ぶのだ。\r\n　「…ねえ、私だよ…？その、クノーテン…だよ？」\r\n　「はぁ？何それ。」\r\n　祭りの時にいろいろと教えてくれた子が聞き返す。\r\n　「あ……何でもないです。ありがとう。」\r\n　「ん。よし、続きだ！」\r\n　彼らは項垂れるクノーテンをおいて元の場所へと走っていった。\r\n　ああ、そうか―\"クノーテン\"は、いなくなったのだった。その意味をようやく正確に理解した。\r\n　これでいいのだ。…これが、自分のあり方。ただ私は…\r\n　クノーテンはとぼとぼと、屋敷への道をたどった。前も見ずに気にせずに静かに歩いていた。\r\n　と、側面に何かがぶつかった。\r\n　「きゃ。」\r\n　ぶつかったそれはいててとさすってすぐにぺこりとお辞儀をする。\r\n　「ごめんなさい。」\r\n　「っ…アイン…」\r\n　え…？と彼は顔をあげてクノーテンをまじまじと見つめる。\r\n　「……にーさん？でも、色が変…それに今は…」\r\n　後ろからいつも通りぱたぱたと付き人が駆けてきた。\r\n　「アイン様…気をつけて…お前は。」\r\n　クノーテンはキョウダイだった子へと向き直るとお辞儀を返す。\r\n　「…？ぶつかったのはあたしだよ？」\r\n　「アイン様、必要ありません。これは生き物ではありませんので。」\r\n　「え？」\r\n　彼はうーんうーんとしばらく悩むが、どうでもいいことだったように笑顔になるとクノーテンの手を引いた。\r\n　「ねえ、一緒に遊ぼ。」\r\n　「「え」」\r\n　付き人は慌てて繋がれた手をほどこうとしたがその前にクノーテン自身がぱしりと無情に振り払った。\r\n　「…できません。私にそのような機能はありませんので。」\r\n　「…？どういうこと？」\r\n　「アイン様？これは形こそ生き物のようですが、実態は道具です。共に遊ぶことはできません。」\r\n　「…そうなの？」と少年を伺う。\r\n　「はい。」\r\n　クノーテンは向きを変える。アインは…何も変わらないのだな。そうして屋敷の方へと進み直す。もう、涙も流れない。いや、涙は悲しいときに流れるものだったのだろうか。これは、悲しいのだろうか。そんなくだらぬことをぼーっと考えながら歩みを進める。屋敷の扉が見えてきたところで彼は暗闇に引きずられていた。周りにはたくさんのフィアデンが手を掲げていた。\r\n　「…？！」\r\n　訳もわからぬままにそれらを四顧していたが何かが頬に触れて彼は正面を向く。\r\n　「…セー、レン？」\r\n　「つカマ、えた…っ」\r\n　彼の体からは稲妻が度々走っているように逆立ち、目は光で瞳もなにも区別がつかなかった。ばちりと跳ねるそれはしかし球状に弾かれる。そうか、フィアデンたちは彼を閉じ込めていたのだ。よく見ると奥に休憩する者らが…頻繁に彼らは交代していているようだった。\r\n　「クノーテン…うれシよ…きてくレタんだネ…っ」\r\n　「ちょうどいい、ツェルクーペ、それを止めろ！」\r\n　スフォリアが叫ぶとセーレンはぐいとクノーテンの首に手を回して抱き締める。\r\n　「クノーテン…すグ、たすケてあげるカラね…」\r\n　クノーテンはスフォリアからの圧力とセーレンへの嫌悪に押し潰されそうであった。\r\n　「…っ……」\r\n　―セルミアーデンに手を出してはいけない―\r\n　セーレンはそのまま首に口づけ、耳元で安心してとささやく。\r\n　―言葉に耳を傾けるな―\r\n　「こんナトコ、いやだロう？誰もいナイとこへいこウ。俺…だケの…」\r\n　―助けを求めるな。私のやるべきことは―\r\n　クノーテンはぐっとセーレンを引き剥がす。彼を真っ直ぐに向いて、\r\n　「セーレン、やめろ。」\r\n　自分でも驚くほど低い声だった。\r\n　「エ……？」\r\n　「今すぐに力を抑えろ。」\r\n　セーレンは目をぱちくりさせたがやがてわかったと頷く。\r\n　「そっカ…クノーテンは操られテイるんだ…」\r\n　「は？」\r\n　少年は自らを捕らえているフィアデンらを見下ろす。クノーテンも後を追う。てっきりいつもの調子で素直に頷いたと油断している顔がいくつか並んでいた。セーレンはその中から王の姿を見つけると、怒りを混ぜた笑顔を向ける。\r\n　「お前がコンなことサセテるんだ…！クノーテンがいうはずナイ…」\r\n　スフォリアは結界を維持しながら無表情にその様を見つめていた。\r\n　「クノーテンの意思ジャない…！」\r\n　いっそう激しく稲妻が走る。\r\n　「私の意思だよ！」\r\n　電光の激しさに負けぬ勢いで叫んだのはクノーテンだった。その叫びにセーレンは振り向く。\r\n　「お前は…何もわかってない！…これは私の意思だ。迷惑だ。やめてくれ…」\r\n　「どうして…？イヤだろう…？」\r\n　「…助けようなんて思われる方が嫌だ。……私は、今の方が幸せだよ。お前の双子のキョウダイをやっていたときより、ただの道具である今の方が。」\r\n　今の他からの態度は、間違いなく位に対する正しいものだった。比べられることなく嫉妬されることなく、ただそれだけでいられる。\r\n　「そんナコトない！クノーテンは侵されてルんだ…！本心じゃなイナら…っ」\r\n　「お前に私の気持ちがわかるのか？」\r\n　クノーテンは片割れをまっすぐに見つめる。その形相はさすがのセーレンをも怯ませた。\r\n　―それはあまりにも、悲哀に満ちていた。\r\n　本人さえ気づかぬほど、寂しい所にいた。\r\n　「………」\r\n　セーレンの瞳が輪郭をとると稲妻は止み、彼はすとんと落っこちた。\r\n　安堵の息がぴたりと揃った。`","export

`　「……さて。」\r\n　スフォリアはフィアデンらにセーレンを連れていけ、町への通達を、とあれこれと指示をだし、ようやく立ち尽くすクノーテンへと向いた。\r\n　「セーレンが\"地下\"から連れ出したとは思えん。」\r\n　「…自分で外に出ました。」\r\n　スフォリアが理由を述べるよう施すと彼は何かを隠そうともせず即答した。\r\n　「しばらく誰も来なかったから、気になって。」\r\n　その答えには後ろから従者が頭を下げた。\r\n　「申し訳ありません。1日別の用事で行かなくて…次の日向かおうと思った矢先、先程の件が…」\r\n　「よい。…まあ、今回ばかりは助かった。だが、勝手な行動は慎め。お前は必要なときにだけ使う。」\r\n　クノーテンは頷くと王が来いと歩き出すのについていった。\r\n　\r\n　「それにしても…ツェルクーペ…でしたかな？あれはなかなか使えますな。」\r\n　街の復興作業を再開したフィアデンの１つが、別のへ世間話をふった。\r\n　「ああ、説明はされていたが…魔法なしでセルミアーデン様を納めてしまうとはな。」\r\n　ぱたぱたと材が形を成していく方へと片腕を向けたまま相槌を打つ。暴走後からしばらくたってようやく完全に修復が完了しようとするのは、単に作業するフィアデンの数が少なかっただけではない。物の崩壊なら造作もないが、セーレンの暴走はしばしば空間までも食らっていた。ともなれば強い魔法を扱えるフィアデンが複数必要となるし、彼らには他の仕事もある。加えて住民のメンタルケアにも労力を必要とした。\r\n　「これで最後か？」\r\n　「ああ。」\r\n　「全く…少し暴れただけでこれだからな。壊れたまちはいくつだっけ？そりゃ、世界相手でも問題ないだろうよ。」\r\n　仕事が一段落ついた彼らはどこかへ寄ろうかと近場の茶屋へと顔を出す。\r\n　「お疲れ様です。」\r\n　「いやいや、君も大変だろう？」\r\n　「いえ、私はちょうど遠出していまして…」\r\n　流行りの店も、今の住民の精神状態ではひどくがらんとしていた。休んでいるのは作業に来た者か、旅の者かといったところだろう。\r\n　「あ、あの…また、こんなことが起きますか？」\r\n　「ん？……さあ、なんとも。とはいえ、我々も全力を尽くしますからね。そう頻繁には。」\r\n　「失礼を申しました。」\r\n　フィアデンがヒトビトやコレンと関わるようになってから、ある程度の災害やそれによる被害は少なくなっていた。というのも、災害が無益というわけでもないので世界を導くフィアデンらはそのすべてを止めようとはしなかったのである。それにしても大昔のような理不尽さは失せ、彼らはほとんど何かに怯えることはなくなっていた。\r\n　「さて、スフォリア様はどうなさるのか…」\r\n　グラスの中身を飲み干して一息ついた。\r\n　\r\n　ひんやりとした黒い壁に手をつくとクノーテンはため息をつく。自分の発した言葉を思い出していた。\r\n　―私は、今の方が幸せだよ。お前の双子のキョウダイをやっていたときより、ただの道具である今の方が。\r\n　そうか、自分はそんな風に思っていたのか。正直あまり考えたことがなかった。本心じゃないだろうと言われてぽろっと出てしまった自分も知らぬ私の願望。ようやくそれを知った気がする。従いたいと思ったのは、目に見える苦しみから早く解放されたいからだと思っていた。けれど、もっと根本的なところで私はそう願っていたのだろう。\r\n　王は、自分の目を見て話してくれるようになった。フィアデンの大人と、ああも当たり前に話したのは初めてであった。セーレンと会話しているのを、あんなに多くのフィアデンが見ていたのに誰も割って入ろうとしないばかりか、そこに侮蔑の視線はなかった。あったのは不安と―期待。こんなに広い部屋で待機できる。いいことは数え上げればきりがない。\r\n　そうだ、私は――\r\n　「クノーテン。」\r\n　聞き覚えのある声がして少年ははっと顔をあげ、辺りを見渡した。しかしどれだけ向きを変えても目を凝らしても、自分ひとつが部屋にいるだけだ。\r\n　「……セーレン…？」\r\n　「ふふ…そうだよ…」\r\n　「どこにいる？…いや、どうしてここが…」\r\n　そこまで言ってクノーテンは自らの口を押さえた。\r\n　「わか…に、きまって…」\r\n　押さえられた口はもごもごと理由をのべようとした。何が起こっているのだ。\r\n　ゆっくり、意思とは関係なく手が離れていく。\r\n　「やめろ…どうなって…？！」\r\n　「ふふ、ここにいるよ。俺は…」\r\n　やはり言葉は、クノーテンの体から発されている。操られている？少年はそう考えてガツンと拳を壁に叩きつけた。\r\n　「…何してるの？」\r\n　「私を解放しろ…」\r\n　「違うよ。」\r\n　クノーテンはまた勝手に手を掲げるように動かすと、そこへ光が生まれる。光は少年の体から少しずつ放たれ、彼の視界を奪うと形をとっていき…フィアデンへとなってぎゅっとクノーテンに抱きついた。反動で彼は尻餅をつく。\r\n　「っ？！」\r\n　「また会えたね、クノーテン。」\r\n　セーレンはクノーテンの背に腕を回したまま嬉しそうに笑った。\r\n　「…セーレン、何でお前が…」\r\n　「へへ…クノーテンごしに来ちゃった。」\r\n　理解が追い付かぬとクノーテンはセーレンを引き剥がし目を丸くしたまま呟く。\r\n　「だってここは…」\r\n　「ああ、あいつも姑息なことするよね。地下に隠しちゃうなんてさ。けど…わかってないのは相変わらずだな。」\r\n　「い、意味がわからない…」\r\n　セーレンはやや目を細めるとじーっと彼を見つめた。気まずくなったクノーテンは目をそらすとえーと…と言葉を探す。\r\n　「け、けどお前倒れて運ばれたんだろ？すぐに見つかるぞ？ほら、きっともうスフォリア様が…」\r\n　ぴっとクノーテンの口へ指を当てて続きの言葉は塞がれてしまう。\r\n　「あんなやつのことなんか話すな。お前は俺だけ呼べば良いんだよ。」\r\n　そうしてそのまま、自らの口を指の反対側の側面へとくっつける。にこりと笑顔を向けたのに、クノーテンはぞっとした。セーレンの指をどかすと震えた声でやめろ…と呟いた。\r\n　「……クノーテンさ、ようやくわかったんじゃないの？」\r\n　「…は？」\r\n　「だからぁ、」\r\n　彼は剥がされて捕まれたままの手をクノーテンのそれごと持ち上げ大切そうに頬擦りする。\r\n　「俺の気持ち…わかったから、\"コロソウ\"としてくれたんでしょ？」\r\n　「っ…？」\r\n　ころす…そうだ、自分は怒りに任せてセーレンに破壊魔法を使おうとしていた。彼がその程度で消えないと分かっていながら、祈るような気持ちで…\r\n　「お前、まさか…」\r\n　「うん。」\r\n　「…初めから私を、消そうと…？」\r\n　「………」\r\n　セーレンは光を失った瞳でクノーテンを見つめる。\r\n　「…？」\r\n　そこには呆れを通り越した何かがあったような気がする。握っていた手を離すと彼は思い出したように目を開く。\r\n　「あ、そうか…クノーテンってたしか、たくさん本を読んでたね。」\r\n　「え…？うん。」\r\n　それが何なのだろう。少年は片割れの次の言葉をじっと待っていた。観念したように彼は話を続ける。\r\n　「憎しみの同義語って、なんだと思う？」\r\n　「は…？」\r\n　待っていた言葉とはかけ離れた突拍子もない問いにクノーテンはバランスを崩す。そんな彼をちらと見るとセーレンは立ち上がる。\r\n　「…恨み、とか？」\r\n　「いいや。」\r\n　「嫌悪？」\r\n　「真面目に言ってる？」\r\n　問答の間てこてこと軽い足取りで歩いていく。何もないはずの上空であるのに、セーレンの背景になった途端に星が見えた気がしてクノーテンは顔を伏せる。\r\n　「じゃあ、なんだよ。」\r\n　「\"愛\"だ。」\r\n　ぴっと彼は振り向きながら指差した。はあ？と再び顔をあげそんな指先を見つめ返す。\r\n　「憎しみも殺したい気持ちも愛することも同じことだよ。」\r\n　「…で？」\r\n　「クノーテンは俺を愛してくれてる。」\r\n　さすがのクノーテンでも、彼とはまともに話ができないのだと悟ると座ったままくるりと向きを変えた。\r\n　「…本気だよ？」\r\n　「はいはい。」\r\n　「事実だよ？」\r\n　セーレンがくるりと指先を回すと彼はもとの方向へ戻されてしまう。\r\n　「俺を見てよ。」\r\n　「うるさいな。お前に私の気持ちなんか、いやお前にはきっと誰の気持ちだって理解できないだろうさ。」\r\n　少年は全く理解していないのか目を白黒させるとクノーテンへと寄っていく。\r\n　「もう帰れよ。」\r\n　「やだ。」\r\n　「…いうことが聞けないのか？」\r\n　「……」\r\n　セーレンはぴたりと歩みを止めると俯いて迷っていた。\r\n　「ほんとのこと、教えてあげようと思ったのに。」\r\n　「もういいよ。お前の言ってることなんか全部でたらめだ。殺したいのに愛してるなんて頭おかしいやつのいうことだもの。」\r\n　クノーテンは頬を膨らませてあくまで顔を背けた。少年はそんな彼を上目に見つめて「それも本に載っていたのか」と尋ねる。\r\n　「…誰でも知ってるよ。好きなものや愛するものだったら大切にする。」\r\n　「俺はクノーテンを大切にしてるよ？」\r\n　「じゃあなんで…私の嫌なことするんだ。」\r\n　「だって絶望させたいもの。壊したい。泣かせたい。苦しんだ姿を見ていたい。」\r\n　「ふざけるな！！」\r\n　クノーテンも立ち上がると、きっと片割れを睨んだ。\r\n　「…大真面目だよ。」\r\n　「わかったよ！お前も\"私\"が嫌いだったんだろ？だから私をこっちの方がいいと思わせるほど追い込んで…」\r\n　「どうしてそうなるのさ。」\r\n　少年はわしゃりと頭を掴む。\r\n　「…もう、いい。お前とは話したくない。頭がいたくなる。」\r\n　「そんなこと言わないでよ。俺はもっと話していたい。」\r\n　無論クノーテンが物理的にセーレンから逃れることなど不可能で、どれだけ逃げても顔を背けても、すぐにセーレンのほうへと引きずられる。\r\n　「…けどね、クノーテンの笑った表情《カオ》も、俺は好きなんだ。喜んでほしいし、楽しんでほしい。」\r\n　「なんで…っ」\r\n　「だから言ってるじゃないか。殺したいも愛してるも同じなんだって。」\r\n　彼は首を振ったが、掴まれた腕は振りほどけなかった。\r\n　「ヒトビトやコレンが殺戮をするときって、俺らみたいに簡単にはいかないだろ？バレたら周りからの信頼も落ちるし、バレたくなきゃ時間をかけて計画をたてなきゃならない。それって嫌いなやつにやるのは物凄く無駄じゃないか？」\r\n　クノーテンの首と肩の間を掴んだまま、彼は珍しく流暢に言葉を連ねる。\r\n　「けど愛してるなら違うね。愛するモノのためならなんだってできるだろ？対象のことを考えて、どう殺そうかどう処理しようか…ずっと、ずーっとそれのことを考えてる。」\r\n　一瞬だけ、クノーテンは納得しかけるもめちゃくちゃな理論だと否定した。\r\n　「ほんとに嫌いなやつにはこう思うはずだよ。『あ、そう。』って。せいぜい、『邪魔だから消えてくれないかな』までだろうな。自分で何かしようなんて思いもしないさ。」\r\n　セーレンは優しく微笑むと腕を掴んでいた手でクノーテンの頬に触れる。\r\n　「ね？だから『殺したい』ってクノーテンが思ってくれたんなら、もう俺たち相思相愛じゃないか。」\r\n　そのまま彼は口を相手のところへ近づける。魔法で拘束されているのか、顔を動かすこともできずにクノーテンは唇を奪われた。精一杯抵抗したつもりだったが、結局深いところまで入られて、離された直後に咳き込んだ。\r\n　「はっきりわかったよ。お前なんか好きになれない…私たちは違いすぎる。」\r\n　「……じゃあ、どうして俺は生まれたんだ？」\r\n　「…はぁ？」\r\n　クノーテンは本気で、もうセーレンと話したくないと思ってはいたものの、彼の言動が一々理解不能で聞き返してしまう。\r\n　「俺はセーレンだけど、この実体とは別に俺の部屋にセーレンは眠ってるんだ。」\r\n　「…？」\r\n　「俺はお前から生まれたんだよ。ついさっきね。」\r\n　微動だにしない彼から困惑の意を汲み取りセーレンは胸へと手を当てる。\r\n　「前に言っただろ？お前は俺なんだよ、クノーテン。だから俺を簡単に生み出せる。」\r\n　「……？？」\r\n　クノーテンは１歩、２歩と後ずさる。勝手に体がそうしていた。嘘だ。そんなはずはない。そう否定したかったのに、まるで受け入れるようにセーレンから離れていた。\r\n　「…違う、俺は……っ？」\r\n　「創造者を親と定義するなら、お前の親がスフォリアでないのは事実だ。」\r\n　「あ、ああ…だって私は…子供として創られたんじゃなくて…」\r\n　合わせてセーレンも１歩、２歩と前へ進む。\r\n　「それも違うよ。そもそもスフォリアは、\"お前\"を創ってなんかいな\r\n　「黙れ！」\r\n　セーレンの言葉をクノーテンは打ち消したものの、恐怖だけは彼をえぐるように膝をつかせた。\r\n　「違う…俺は道具なんだ。スフォリア様が創った…」\r\n　「…だからあいつは、自分の知らないお前を気味悪がって差別した。周りを気にして\"双子\"ってことにしてさ。」\r\n　「だ、だったら…私はなんなんだよっ…お前が好きな、”俺”は…」\r\n　「…さっきから言ってるだろう？お前は俺さ。俺がこの世界で唯一愛している、俺なんだ。」\r\n　ぎゅっと、クノーテンは目をつむった。\r\n　夢の世界へ―ただのキョウダイであるあの世界へ…\r\n　けれどもかけられた魔法でそれは叶わない。\r\n　「お前…やっぱり変だ。自分を愛しているなんて…」\r\n　「変なのは他のやつらだ。どうして他なんか愛せるんだ？」\r\n　やがてクノーテンの背に壁がぶつかる。その先は扉も階段もないただの地。\r\n　「俺はさ、創られてすぐに自分が愛しいことに気づいたんだ。けど、自分が１つである限りは、せいぜいなことしかできない。だからお前を創った。俺であり、別としても動ける《私》を。…ねえクノーテン、俺と楽しいことしよう…？」\r\n　「ひっ…」\r\n　クノーテンはセーレンが手招きするとそちらへ歩み戻っていく。これから行われるなにかを想像して顔をひきつらせながら、ゆっくりと近づいていく。\r\n　セーレンの手がクノーテンのお腹へ触れると、彼の腕は彼の中へと入っていく。\r\n　「ぎっ…」\r\n　「痛いのは最初だけ。すぐに気持ちよくなるから…」\r\n　忍び込んだ手の先をあちこち撫でまわすように動かすと次第にクノーテンの頬は赤く染まる。\r\n　「ふふ…」\r\n　そのまま反対の腕は背に回り、そちらからも入り込むと中を優しく撫でていく。\r\n　寂しそうに開いた口は口で塞いで、隙間から液体が流れ出る。セーレンはクノーテンと共に宙へと浮くと足で足を絡めとってそれらを1組となるようくっつける。\r\n　「あ…はは…きもちいいね…？クノーテン…」\r\n　びくりとクノーテンが痙攣するとセーレンも蕩けるような表情となる。\r\n　「俺だけを見て…俺だけを感じて…」\r\n　「…、せ、れん…」\r\n　少年は快楽に溺れてもはや振りほどく気力もなかった。\r\n　「クノーテンにはもっと気持ちよくなってもらうよ…？」\r\n　そう言った彼の瞳が光るとクノーテンの反応は大きくなる。直接感情に悦を注入されたようだった。\r\n　「クノーテン…俺のこと、すき？」\r\n　「すひっらい、すき…っ」\r\n　セーレンは微笑むと同じ質問をした。\r\n　「…愛してくれる？」\r\n　彼は虜になっていた。\r\n　「愛してる…セーレン…」\r\n　「俺もだよ。」\r\n　しかし彼が答えると同時に分離し、クノーテンは苦しみ出す。セーレンの手は、彼の体へと\"突き抜けられて\"いた。\r\n　「アぐっ？！…ふ…は…」\r\n　「うふふふっははっさいっこうだね！」\r\n　セーレンがぐちゅぐちゅと腕を上下させる。隙間からクノーテンの体液が飛び出していく。\r\n　「あっ…が…せ、れん…なん…で…」\r\n　「だから言ってるだろう？！俺はお前を犯したいし殺したいんだよ！！もう、これで何回目かな…」\r\n　彼の瞳は恋慕に染まったままであった。\r\n　「…え」\r\n　しかしそれ以上を聞くより早く、クノーテンは絶命した―\r\n　\r\n　はっと勢いよく起き上がると、待ってましたと言わんばかりにセーレンが抱きつく。\r\n　「？！…あれ…」\r\n　「もっとやる？」\r\n　耳元で囁かれた言葉に恐怖を覚え、\r\n　「うるさい、離れろっ！！」\r\n　クノーテンが突き飛ばすとそのまま少年は倒れこんだ。\r\n　「ふふっあははは…フフ…」\r\n　「な、にがおかしい…」\r\n　「いやあ、今回は覚えてるんだと思ってさ。」\r\n　寝転がったままで彼は続ける。\r\n　「何が…」\r\n　「シんだの、覚えてるんだろ？」\r\n　「っ…？！」\r\n　クノーテンは反射的に正面をセーレンから背ける。\r\n　「えーと…６７かな。」\r\n　「…何が」\r\n　「俺を殺した数。たぶん６７万。連続で何回もヤったときもあったし。ショックやら何やらで今までのは記憶してないみたいだけどさ。」\r\n　彼の顔は蒼白に染まる。先程のことを思い出して口を押さえた。\r\n　「うええ…」\r\n　「はは、記憶したままやるのも楽しそうだね。」\r\n　ひょいとセーレンは上体を起こす。\r\n　「ほら、暴走してるときも１回コロシてるし…あ、でもあの時はあいつらが殺したんだよな…」\r\n　「は…はあ…いや…」\r\n　「…ナニが？」\r\n　「お前なんか…嫌いだ。もうやめろよ。どうして…また戻すんだよ…」\r\n　えーと、と口許に手を当てる。\r\n　「…それは記憶のこと？それとももう一度創ってる方？」\r\n　「どっちでもいい！どっかいけ…嫌だ、もう…」\r\n　セーレンは立ち上がってぱっぱと服を払う。そしてクノーテンへと笑顔を見せた。\r\n　「いや。今日はたっぷり愛してあげるから…」\r\n　「…」\r\n　「もう嫌いだなんて思わなくなるくらい、快楽をあげるよ。」\r\n　そうして彼は…再び彼とひとつになった。`","export

`　「………」\r\n　「…何があったのだ？」\r\n　従者が顔を出す頃にはセーレンは消え、乱れたクノーテンが横たわっているのみであった。別にタイミングがよかった訳ではない。なんとなく、ここへ来る気乗りがしなかったのだ。それが魔法によるものだと彼は夢にも思うまい。\r\n　「おい、ツェルクーペ。何があったか報告しろ。」\r\n　「………」\r\n　少年の肩を揺らし、目を開いているのに反応がないのを疑問に思ってうつ伏せの体を仰向けに動かす。\r\n　「？！」\r\n　そこには紛れもなく、そういうことをした痕がのこっていた。\r\n　「な…な、なん…ッ？！」\r\n　従者はへたりと腰を抜かす。\r\n　そもそもフィアデンに身体的な繁殖能力はない。そういう行いはもっぱら承認欲求から来るもので、自らの心を相手に許しきって存在を一時的融合状態におき、恐怖に近い快楽を得る。\r\n　というわけで必要なものでもなければ忌み嫌うものの方が多かった。そのような痕があるというのは、融合後しばらく残る渦のようなものである。\r\n　相手に心を委ねきることではじめて溶けることが可能であるために無理矢理ということはまずない。感情を操れれば話は変わってくるが、仮にもフィアデンに似た存在である彼の心を瞬間的にどうこうするなど、スフォリアであってもできるかどうかは怪しいものである。\r\n　と、いうことは。\r\n　「…誰とやっていた？」\r\n　自らが望んで、ということになる。それならば彼は今の状態に満足していないという話となり、彼はもう一度洗脳をやり直さねばとため息をつく。しかしクノーテンはそんな従者を見向きもしないでぽそりと呟いた。\r\n　「セー…レン……」\r\n　「…よりによって…スフォリア様に報告しなければ…」\r\n　彼はくるりと背を向けるように立つと意識を集中しかけ、ここからではまずいと再び階段を上がっていく。\r\n　こつこつと響く足音が遠ざかり、増えて大きくなって帰ってきた。\r\n　「…なるほどな。」\r\n　スフォリアがため息をつくとぴくりと今度は反応があった。クノーテンはのそのそと起き上がる。そして顔を見るより早く王の前へひれ伏した。\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　驚いたのは従者の方であった。\r\n　「…セーレンはいまだ自室で休息中のはずだが。」\r\n　「…そ、そうですよね。洗脳も解かれてはいないようですし。」\r\n　スフォリアは面をあげろと命令する。クノーテンはその通りに顔をあげた。ひどくやつれて顔色が悪い。\r\n　「…何があった？」\r\n　「……セーレン…」\r\n　「誰に何をされたかきいている。」\r\n　「……」\r\n　クノーテンは虚ろな瞳で王を見返した。\r\n　「また、私に逆らうか？」\r\n　スフォリアは試すように口角をつり上げる。少年は静かに首を振った。\r\n　「いえ…何を、されたのか…よく、覚えていません。」\r\n　確かにそれでは答えようもないかと彼は納得しかけたが、それにしてはなぜ彼の名を呟いたのかが気にかかり目を細める。\r\n　「…セーレンに助けを求めるか。」\r\n　「いえ…わかりません。が、ただ、名を呼びたくなるのです。」\r\n　「やつに会いたいか？」\r\n　クノーテンは少しだけぼーっとしていたがゆっくりと首を振る。王はため息をつくと従者へ向き直る。\r\n　「すぐにセーレンに確認をとれ。もしかしたら…ここがバレたのかもしれない。」\r\n　「部屋を抜け出してここまで来ていたのですか？しかしそれなら付き人が騒ぐはずです。」\r\n　「…ああ。だが、無関係ではないだろう。」\r\n　スフォリアはくいと指を曲げる。クノーテンがふらふらと立ち上がった。\r\n　「しかし疲労がすごいな。今にもシにそうじゃないか。」\r\n　少年の表情は何も感じていないようであったが、明らかに体は限界へきている。回復のため魔法を使ったところでどうにかなるものでもないようで、スフォリアは目で従者に合図する。青年は頷くとクノーテンを両腕で抱え、３つは階段へと向かった。\r\n　\r\n　階段を中ほどまで上ったときであった。\r\n　「なっ…？」\r\n　従者が呟き、王がそちらを見ると、クノーテンの体はちらちらと崩れて行く。それは、彼がシんだことを意味する。\r\n　「……まさか、そんな…」\r\n　さすがのスフォリアもこの事態を想像していなかった。フィアデンの死など、そう簡単に起こり得るものではない。膨大な力を一気に失うとかより強いものに殺されるでもなければ、後は自ら望んで消えるかである。\r\n　王とその従者は段差のある床で足をかけたまま立ち尽くす。\r\n　と。\r\n　さらさらとまた光が集まり、傷のなおった元のクノーテンが従者の腕に戻ってくる。\r\n　「これは…？」\r\n　「……」\r\n　スフォリアは気づかれぬ程度の歯ぎしりをすると従者の横を通りすぎ足早に地上へと向かった。\r\n　彼らは地表に出るとすぐ転移魔法を発動し、セーレンの部屋へと出現する。驚いたのは付き人で、ベッドへ横になっていたセーレンはぱっと明るくなった。\r\n　「クノーテンっ！」\r\n　しかし彼を抱える従者と少年の間にスフォリアは入り込むと彼を睨み付ける。\r\n　「セーレンよ…知っていることをすべて話すがいい。」\r\n　「……」\r\n　付き人は立ち上がると、場違いを悟りお辞儀だけして出ていった。\r\n　「…もう、わかったんだろ。」\r\n　「話しなさい。」\r\n　はあ、とため息をつくセーレンを従者が訝しんだ。\r\n　「…そうだよ。クノーテンは俺の造物だ。」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　「やはりか。」\r\n　青年は少年と王とを交互に見つめる。\r\n　「返せよ。俺のなんだから。」\r\n　「今まで何をしていた？」\r\n　「ずっとここで寝てたよ。」\r\n　セーレンがわざとらしく微笑み、返すように王も笑った。\r\n　「ふ…そのわりには、あまり\"寂しそう\"ではないな…？…ついさっきやりたいことが終わってスッキリしたか？」\r\n　「………」\r\n　笑顔であるのに険悪な気まずい場を従者は耐えきれずに説明を求めたが、どちらも退かずに話してはくれなかった。\r\n　しばしの沈黙。会話を生んだのはクノーテンだった。\r\n　「うっ…」\r\n　「！」\r\n　「クノーテン！」\r\n　彼は目を開けると混乱したように虹彩を震わせる。従者が自分を抱えて、しかもセーレンの部屋にいることの理解が全くできなかった。\r\n　そんな彼を青年は降ろすと、セーレンが嬉しそうににこりと笑う。\r\n　「せ…セーレン…」\r\n　「どうだ？思い出したか。」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　また忘れちゃったの？とセーレンも首をかしげたが、クノーテンは何が何やらさっぱりであった。\r\n　「そっか…先を知る恐怖もなかなか良かったのにな。」\r\n　独り言へ侮蔑の視線を向け、スフォリアはクノーテンへ質問を続ける。\r\n　「先ほどのことは覚えているか？」\r\n　「えと…？」\r\n　少年は視線をあちこちにやって必死に思い出そうとする。\r\n　「…お前は、先程一度シんだのだ。」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　スフォリアは言うとすぐにセーレンへと向き直る。彼もまたつまらなさそうに睨み返した。\r\n　さーっと、事実が頭をよぎっていった。\r\n　――しんだ…死んだ…シんだ？！\r\n　親子は今にも口論を再会しようとした。しかしすぐにクノーテンの呻き声に意識をとられた。\r\n　「うう…うっ…せ、れん…」\r\n　呼ばれて彼はにやりと笑う。\r\n　「おいでクノーテン。」\r\n　彼はとぼとぼとベッドへと向かうとぽんとそこへ腰かけた。後ろからぎゅっとセーレンが抱き締める。\r\n　２つはその様をただ見つめ、はっと我に返った従者が叱りつける。\r\n　「っツェルクーペ！何をしている…」\r\n　「違うよ。こいつはクノーテンだもの。ねえ？」\r\n　「セーレン…せーれん…」\r\n　セーレンはぺろりと耳をなめそれに答えた。従者が口を押さえたのは言うまでもない。\r\n　「…ふ、よもや、心を上書きするとはな。」\r\n　「聞き捨てならないな。クノーテンは俺のこと好きだって言ってくれたよ。」\r\n　「言わせたのだろう？」\r\n　ムッと口を寄せた少年に、王は証拠を見せてやろう、と挑発する。\r\n　「ツェルクーペ、戻れ。」\r\n　「必要ないよ。ここにいて。」\r\n　セーレンの腕に力が入る。彼はそれをやさしく持つとしかしほどくように動かした。\r\n　「…クノーテン…？」\r\n　「……」\r\n　彼は無言のまま迷いなく立ち上がり、そのまま王のもとへ帰って行ってしまう。\r\n　「どうして？！俺だったらずっと愛をあげるよ！気持ちよくしてあげるよ？痛いのが嫌なら我慢するから…」\r\n　見放された彼は必死に説得を試みる。スフォリアが滑稽だと言わんばかりに鼻で笑った。\r\n　「セーレン、お前は何もわかってはいない。」\r\n　クノーテンはスフォリアのもとまで来ると横に控えるようにセーレンへと向き直る。\r\n　「…ごめん、セーレン…」\r\n　「所詮上部の支配では王にはなれぬな。」\r\n　ぎり…と怒りの音が聞こえてセーレンの髪が逆立ってゆく。\r\n　「怒っても仕方がないだろう。これは私に仕えることを選んだのだ。快楽は所詮恐怖に勝てない。」\r\n　「クノーテン…戻ってこい。そんな恐怖すぐに消し去ってやる…」\r\n　彼はまだ瞳の輪郭をはっきりとさせてはいたが、もはや王とて容易には動けぬほどに場を支配していた。\r\n　「違う。」\r\n　張り詰めた空気をものともせずにクノーテンが切り捨てる。\r\n　「何が？」\r\n　「私は別に…恐怖なんか感じてない。…私も、初めはそう思ってたけど…違ったんだ。」\r\n　セーレンは退かぬまま、しかし進まぬままクノーテンの言葉を待つ。\r\n　「私はきっと…自分の場所がほしかったんだな。自己満足じゃない、他者に認められた自分という枠。…『クノーテン』のときはお前という俺くらいにしか認めてもらえてなかった…まあ、アインや子供らはよくわかってなかったから私を認識していたかもしれないけど…きっとみんなすぐにわかる。」\r\n　彼は少し間をおいて続きを述べた。\r\n　「外に上がったとき、皆は『クノーテン』のことを忘れていたよ。不要だったからスフォリア様がそうしたんだろ。…けどそのときに私は寂しさを感じなかった。…感じることができなかった。それこそが、今の自分に定義された枠にふさわしい扱いだったから。やっと…俺は\"私\"を手に入れたんだ。」\r\n　しんと静まり返った部屋の中、セーレンは音もなく首を振る。声をあげたのはスフォリアだった。\r\n　「クク…ははは。…わかったか、セーレン。所詮お前の独りよがりな欲望なのだ。いや、お前自身からでさえ否定されてしまったか…？」\r\n　憶測ではあったろうが、王は皮肉を述べた。ぴくりとその言葉に反応した少年は無理矢理クノーテンを自分の手元へ引き寄せ始める。\r\n　「っ…」\r\n　「もう…どうでもいいや。」\r\n　ずりずりと足が床を擦る。なんとか踏ん張ろうと全力で彼は重力を増幅させていた。\r\n　「…裏切るんだったら心なんて要らない。俺の創った感情だけ受け止めてろよ。」\r\n　「ッ？！…ぐ…あぁ…」\r\n　「セーレン！」\r\n　叱るように叫ぶとスフォリアが加勢する。しかし少年の目が彼を捉えると閃光が走り王は壁へと打ち付けられる。青年が慌てた。\r\n　「あ…が…うう…」\r\n　「壊れろよ。下らない洗脳なんかされやがって。」\r\n　「ツェルクーペ、抑え込め！」\r\n　ふっとクノーテンの足が地面から離れる。スフォリアが体勢をたて直しながらセーレンへと攻撃するも彼は気にせぬように手元へと来たクノーテンを撫でた。\r\n　「上書き？上等だ…俺のための俺なんだもの。俺がどうしようと自由だろう？」\r\n　「や…め…」\r\n　「お前は自分に素直になればよい！」「俺を愛してくれるだろ？！」\r\n　親子が同時に叫ぶ。クノーテンは限界だった。\r\n　「……やめロッ！！」\r\n　「！？」\r\n　彼が叫ぶと目を丸くしたのはセーレンだった。そうして次の瞬間、部屋が光に包まれると横たわったセーレンの側にクノーテンが立ち尽くしていた。部屋は荒れ、誰もが意識を失っていた。さらさらと、体が流れていく…クノーテンは頭を抱える。何を行ったのか、彼にはわからなかった。\r\n　けれども、きっと自分が…\r\n　「彼らをコロシたのだ」\r\n　流れ行くフィアデンらを順に見つめて彼はようやく事の重大さに気づいた。\r\n　\r\n　「あれから…一体どうなったのです？」\r\n　従者は窓の側に立ち、外で遊ぶ無邪気な子供らを見つめる。とはいえ、景色の内容はまるで頭に入ってこなかった。\r\n　「…予想以上だったのだ。」\r\n　「と、言いますと？」\r\n　スフォリアは自室の机に腕をたててもたれる。その顔は喜びに満ちていた。\r\n　「我らはあのとき…しんだ。」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　「そう、無論そんなことができるのはセーレンくらいのものだろう。けれども同時にやつもしんでいる。」\r\n　青年は続きを待つ。\r\n　「…残っていたのはあの子の方だ。」\r\n　スフォリアは立ち上がるといっそう妖しく笑って見せる。\r\n　「ツェルクーペの制御能力は予想以上だ。あれ自らが『セルミアーデン』の能力を扱えたのだよ。」\r\n　ようやくことを理解した青年が、王につられて笑っていた。\r\n　\r\n　セーレンとクノーテンはひとまずということでその場に閉じ込められていた。\r\n　「ねえ？さっき俺をころしたよね？ねえ？」\r\n　「………」\r\n　「愉しかったろ？気持ちいいだろ？じゃなきゃ、元に戻すことなんてしないもんな…」\r\n　クノーテンがベッドの縁に腰掛け、その周りをセーレンがくるくる回りながら楽しそうに声をかけていた。\r\n　「……」\r\n　クノーテンは無視を続けていた。というより、思い出したくもなかった。\r\n　「あはは…ころされる側もいいもんだなぁ…ね、こんどはヤりながらころしてよ。」\r\n　相変わらずの彼に一度ため息をついてクノーテンは立ち上がる。少し前まで彼はこんなに素直ではなかった。だから自分は、素直になってほしいと、セーレン自身のために力を使ってほしいと、願ってはいたけれど…\r\n　「…クノーテン…俺のこときらい？」\r\n　「…別に。好きでも嫌いでもない。」\r\n　そう切り捨てて歩き出そうとすると、ぐいと引き寄せられ抱き締められる。\r\n　「やだっ…どっちかにしてよ。それじゃ、俺よくわかんないよ…」\r\n　「勝手にしろよ。」\r\n　彼がにらむと、セーレンは想いとは対称に彼を解放する。クノーテンにももうわかっていた。自分が、あのとき何をしたのか。…何をできてしまうのか。\r\n　「クノーテン…お前は俺だよ？」\r\n　「考え方によっちゃ、お前の方が私でもある。」\r\n　「俺がお前を創ったんだ…俺のために。」\r\n　「私が創ったかもしれない。」\r\n　「だってお前は俺を望んでないだろ。」\r\n　ふっとクノーテンが無駄に広い天井を見上げると、そこに星空が宿る。\r\n　「この能力は望んでいたさ。…いいね、すごく気分がいい。何でも手に入れられそうだ。」\r\n　むっとセーレンは口を寄せた。\r\n　「そんなの…クノーテンじゃない。」\r\n　「ああそうさ。私は『ツェルクーペ』…」\r\n　「そういう意味じゃないっ」\r\n　少年の叫び声と同時に扉は消え、スフォリアが現れた。\r\n　「行くぞ、ツェルクーペ。…もはやそれ自体に、何の用もない。」\r\n　セーレンは入ってきた親を睨むと再びクノーテンを自分へ寄せる。\r\n　「…だったらわかるだろ。あんなの、簡単だって。」\r\n　耳元へぽそりと呟く。クノーテンは見定めるようにスフォリアを見つめた。\r\n　「…何をしている。」\r\n　「もう、あんたに従う必要もないかなって。」\r\n　「…なんだと？」\r\n　くすくすとクノーテンは片割れに抱かれたまま笑顔を見せる。彼は不思議そうに見守っていた。\r\n　「冗談ですよ。私があなたに逆らうわけないでしょう。」\r\n　あ…とセーレンが呟くとクノーテンはとことこと王のもとへと歩いていってしまう。\r\n　「……」\r\n　「不満そうですね。」\r\n　「お前の笑みがな、不気味で仕方ない。」\r\n　「だってあなたの方が、私がいなくなったらまずいって感じですもの。」\r\n　少年の寂しそうな表情だけを残して、２つは部屋を出ていった。`","export const novel = `　そこは、小さな小さな部屋だった。\r\n　まるで本を置くことが目的のように、家具を詰め込んだような部屋だった。\r\n　少年はベッドへ寝転がると無造作に敷かれた布団を抱き締める。もはやそこに温もりなど残ってはいないが、そうでもしないと寂しくてしんでしまいそうなのだ。\r\n　あれから―クノーテンがクノーテンとして、フィアデンのひとつとして認められたあのときから、立場は逆転していた。セーレンは存在を消されて、クノーテンが皇子として仕事をしていた。クノーテンはよく働いた。もともと素質があった。セーレンは能力さえなければ、他から忌まれていたのだ。スフォリアの毛嫌いさえなければ…皆は初めからクノーテンを嫌うことなどなかったであろう。\r\n　部屋も入れ換えられた。部屋には誰も来なかった。\r\n　セーレンは迫り来る本棚の本にも、クノーテンの書き残した紙にも見向きもせず、ただじっとしていた。けれども彼は絶望も悲しみも感じてはいなかった。どこかで、彼が今準備をしているのだとわかっていた。ただ側に彼がいない寂しさだけはどうすることもできずに、こうして彼の眠っていた場所にいるのだった。\r\n　\r\n　「クノータデンス様。」\r\n　「ん…？」\r\n　振り向いた先でフィアデンがお辞儀をする。\r\n　「少し、町へお願いできますか？」\r\n　彼の表情から、それなりの困りごとがあるということは容易に想像できる。彼は頷くと、通りへ転移する。ざわざわ、ヒトビトやコレンが囁きあっていた。絶望したのか膝をつくものやフィアデンへ乞うようにしがみつくものもいた。\r\n　「何があったんだ？」\r\n　彼は声をかけてきたフィアデンへ問いかけながら辺りを見渡す。奥にスフォリアの姿もあった。\r\n　「それが…復興が完全ではなかったようで。」\r\n　クノーテンはセーレンの暴走を思い出す。\r\n　「むしろ空間ごと抉られていたところは良かったのです。しかし、中途半端に失った土地の一部は残った部分を糧にしてしまったためか草木が全く…」\r\n　確かに、彼の言うように土地には濁った色の土ばかりが散らばっている。\r\n　「…なるほどね。」\r\n　クノーテンは歩き出す。気づいたものたちが彼に道を譲り、件の土地の目の前まで来る。しゃがんで土を片手に掬った。\r\n　「…うん、これなら大丈夫だな。」\r\n　彼は立ち上がり手にした土をぱっと払う。こぼれ落ちたそれらから波紋が生まれて、どこまでも広がっていった。くるりと側のコレンを振り向く。\r\n　「あんたでいいや。試しに種蒔いてみろよ。」\r\n　言われてあたふたとしていたコレンであったが、皆の期待の視線を受けると土へ近づきちょんと触れる。側にいたフィアデンが栄養を与えれば、みるみる苗となり茎となる。わっと歓声が上がり、またきっと…フィアデンの株が上がった。クノーテンは戻ったことを確認するとまた別へと転移した。\r\n　「…大人しく公務をこなしているようだな。」\r\n　「いやあ、さすがですね。…どうかされました？」\r\n　スフォリアはクノーテンの去り場を見つめたまま、目を細めていた。\r\n　「いや、杞憂のようだ。」\r\n　彼が言っているのは、クノーテンが冗談だと述べたことについてだ。そもそも\"彼\"とはそこまで深い関わりをしていなかったためか、冗談を言うところなどほとんど、あるいは全く見たことがなかった。加えて、あのような優越な表情も、自信で満ち溢れているところも、今までの彼からは想像がつかない。とはいえ、彼は忠実に―助言として意見をのべることはあれど―反抗もなくヒトビトやコレン、フィアデンを導いている。セーレンの難儀な性格を取り除いたような理想の個体であるとまで思えてくるのだ。計画も着々と進んでいる。彼は完全に力を制御できたし、必要以上をやらない。\r\n　―だったら、何だというのだ。この、焦燥は…\r\n　遅れて彼も\"そこ\"へ転移した。\r\n　\r\n　黒い岩壁に蒼の光が走るように強さを変えていた。フィアデンのうちで最も重要で神聖なる施設は限られたものだけが入れる固有空間にあった。\r\n　広さはそれほどない。ひとつかふたつ用の演舞のステージのように少し上がった丸の台と、周りに柱を半分にしたものが囲っている程度である。\r\n　「…ああ。…いやいや、……うん。」\r\n　クノーテンは黒い衣に身を包み、台へ座り込むとひとつで相づちを打っていた。きらきらと岩を走る光が彼と戯れているようであった。\r\n　そこへスフォリアが許可を申し出る。クノーテンは了承すると彼が顕現する。\r\n　「…何か？」\r\n　「ずいぶんと気さくなものだな。…会話もできるのか？」\r\n　「そりゃ、私とセーレンができるんだから、簡単に。」\r\n　王は以前セーレンとここへ来たことを思い出す。同期こそ容易だったものの、それ以上を彼はしなかった。できなかったのかやろうとしなかったのかは定かではないが。\r\n　「で、本題は？そろそろ、私にこんなことさせる目的を話して欲しいな。」\r\n　「…そうだな。」\r\n　顎に手を当てるようにして考えるポーズを取るが、端からそのつもりはないのだろう、彼は話をそらす。\r\n　「その衣は？セーレンのときと違うようだが。」\r\n　「は？…ああ、なんかここ来ると勝手に変わるんだよね…あれの趣味じゃないか？」\r\n　そんなものではないだろうと王がため息をつくと彼も返すように目を細める。\r\n　「…まだ、な。お前が真にフィアデンのためを思っているのかが、どうにも。」\r\n　「ちゃんと仕事はしてるだろ？私だって誰かのために力を使うのは嫌いじゃないし…まだ不満が？」\r\n　言葉遣い？とクノーテンはからかったがスフォリアは動じずに例の場所へ来いとだけ述べる。\r\n　「私に修行は必要ないぞ。」\r\n　「傲るのはよくない。」\r\n　「はいはい。」\r\n　彼はひとつ伸びをするとぱっと姿を消した。\r\n　\r\n　クノーテンは\"フィアデンにとって一番大切なこと\"を終え、自室のベッドへ腰かける。仕事はたくさんあった。けれどもどれだけ魔法を使おうと気疲れ以外は疲労を感じない。\r\n　―今まではちょこっと魔法を使うだけでもへばってたのにな… \r\n　じっと己の手を見つめる。自分の扱う力―しかしそれというよりも、もっと自分に近いように感じる。制御とか暴走とか…そういうのではないのだ。\r\n　彼は「自分」を認識してようやく力を持ち、そしてセーレンが\"なぜ暴走したのか\"が理解できた。\r\n　「…どうした？……なら、いいけど。」\r\n　あの場所でなくとも、\"それ\"との会話は容易だった。こんこんとたたく音がして、気づいたクノーテンはそちらへ顔を向ける。\r\n　「にーさん、いる？」\r\n　「アインか。どうした？」\r\n　扉が透けると幼子が不審そうにちらちらと反対を振り向いていた。\r\n　「あのね、お向かいから変な音が聞こえるの。あそこ、ただの物置よね？」\r\n　「向かい…？」\r\n　クノーテンは彼の視線を追う。そこは自分の―セーレンがいるはずの部屋であった。\r\n　少年は危ないかもしれないからとアインを部屋へ招き入れ待機するよう言い、扉を閉めると自分はそちらへ向かっていった。\r\n　じっと、耳をすましてみる。\r\n　確かに何か呻くような水滴のような不気味な音がした。\r\n　クノーテンは一度だけ自室の戸と廊下を気にして、例の部屋へ転移する。\r\n　「…クノーテンっ？！」\r\n　当たり前だが、セーレンがいた。布団に横たわって…自らを抱き締めるように震えていた。顔の火照りから、それが恐怖や寒さによるものではないとすぐにわかる。\r\n　「…何してんだ？」\r\n　「わかんない…」\r\n　ちょいちょいと彼は手招きするもクノーテンは首を振る。\r\n　「お前は今いないことになってる。」\r\n　「知ってる。邪魔する気もない。ただ…」\r\n　彼はぺろりと自らの指を舐める。少年は冷ややかに見下した。\r\n　「早くしろ。お前に付き合うほど暇じゃない。」\r\n　「おねガい…きスだけ、して…おさえらレソうに、ない…」\r\n　ああ、なるほどと彼は布団へ腰かけた。すぐにセーレンがしがみつく。\r\n　「あいつが騒いでたのはお前のせいか。」\r\n　「うん…ほんとは、めいワクかけたくなかったけど…」\r\n　「いいよ。それでなんとかなるんなら。」\r\n　セーレンとて、能力を失ったわけではない。同じ力をクノーテンが扱っているというだけの話で…\r\n　少年は貪るように彼に食らいつく。荒い息づかいと、ぴちゃぴちゃという音が響いてクノーテンは嫌そうな顔をした。\r\n　「……うん、もう大丈夫。」\r\n　「あいつらさ、あんまわかってないよな。こんな風に閉じ込めたら余計暴走するだけだってのに…」\r\n　「いいよ。…やりたいことあるんだろ？でもまだ探ってる？」\r\n　クノーテンは扉の方へ向けていた視線を戻すともう一度彼に口づける。驚いたセーレンであったが、素直に舌を絡めた。\r\n　「あ…珍しいな。お前からしてくれるなんて。」\r\n　「必要だったらこれくらいなんともないさ。もう少しかかりそうだ。…ちょっと態度がまずかったかな。スフォリアがなかなか吐かない。」\r\n　「けど、想像はついたんだろ？」\r\n　「まあね。『魔法』の仕掛けはわかったさ。」\r\n　セーレンは微笑んで頑張ってね、と呟く。\r\n　「実験はそろそろ完了するし、そこから詰めてみるかなぁ…」\r\n　クノーテンはぐっと伸びをして、アインが不安がったままだったと急いで帰っていく。彼の消えた光を見つめて、セーレンは再び転がった。\r\n　アインは警戒するように扉を見つめていた。そこへクノーテンが戻ってくると恐怖と期待を向けてどうだったかときいた。\r\n　「ん？ああ、大丈夫。もうなんともないよ。」\r\n　「ほんと？」\r\n　「けどな、コレンが入り込んじゃってて、大人にばれるとそいつが怒られちゃうから、内緒だぞ？」\r\n　少年はしーっと指を口へ当てた。彼も目を輝かせて頷く。\r\n　「あ、それとさ。」\r\n　キョウダイが秘密、秘密と楽しむように呟いているのを眺め、先ほどのことを思い出した。\r\n　「アイン、なんか魔法使ってみろ。」\r\n　「え、どうして？」\r\n　「いいからいいから。ほら、茶作ってみろよ。」\r\n　アインは不思議そうな顔のまま手のひらを見つめる形で広げる。ぴくりと一瞬わずかに動いたものの、何も起こらなかった。\r\n　「…あれ？」\r\n　クノーテンはにこりと微笑む。\r\n　「やっぱり、供給は食事か…」\r\n　「どういうこと？」\r\n　少年は視線を合わせると、ちゃんと言いつけ守ったんだな、と頭を撫でる。\r\n　何が何やらわからなかったが、幼い彼は誉められただけで満足であった。`","export const novel = `　少し前、クノーテンはアインに、食事のときに「それ」を入れてから食べるように、と言いつけていたのだ。アインはその小さな指でもすぐに落ちてしまいそうな粒の入った袋を受けとる。\r\n　「ちょっと試してみたいんだよ。とうさんには内緒な？」\r\n　「うん。」\r\n　それは実験であった。果たして、クノーテンの予想した通りに彼は魔法を扱えなくなったのだ。アインが帰っていき、少年はひとつ静かに微笑む。\r\n　「…あいつに言っとけよ。思ったより、早く終わりそうだ。」\r\n　それから数日がたつ。\r\n　相変わらずクノーテンは様々なものを助け、導いていた。スフォリアも、そろそろ頃合いではないかと思い始めていた。そして定期的に行われていた「修行」を終え、クノーテンは台から降りるとすぐには戻らず従者らと話をしているスフォリアのもとへ歩いていく。彼は少年に気づくと話を切り上げて微笑んだ。\r\n　「能力は完璧に把握しているな。」\r\n　クノーテンは微笑み返して続きを待つ。\r\n　「…そうだな。そろそろ話そう。来るといい。」\r\n　スフォリアは少年と側近を同時に転移させ自室の椅子へ腰かけた。\r\n　「あのことを話すので？」\r\n　「これ以上もったいぶる必要もなかろう。クノーテンよ…お前はフィアデンが好きか？」\r\n　少年は表情を変えずに頷く。\r\n　「ええ、もちろん。」\r\n　「ならば今のフィアデンとヒトビトやコレンの関係はどう思っている？」\r\n　聞かれて彼は首をかしげる。\r\n　「どういうことです？」\r\n　「何、ただの確認だ。…現状には満足か。」\r\n　考えるように目をそらすと従者らの険しい表情が伺えた。\r\n　「…まあ。考えたことありませんけど。」\r\n　「そうだな。その答えは最もだ。」\r\n　スフォリアは目で合図を送る。受け取ったものがこくりと頷いて映像を見せる。内容としては、ヒトビトやコレンがそれらだけで話し合っているものだった。タイトルをつけるなら\"反抗\"が正しいだろうか。つまり現状に納得のいっていない者たちがフィアデンをどうこうしたいと思っているらしい。\r\n　「…これが何か。」\r\n　「これは少し離れた、我々があまり直接赴かない土地での会話だ。気にならないか。」\r\n　クノーテンは涼しい顔で答える。\r\n　「別に。フィアデンの能力は彼らには越えられない。エネルギーだって、自分達じゃろくに確保できないんでしょう？」\r\n　「…まあ、そうなんだがな。しかし、調和は乱れる。世界のためにも、それはあってはならん。」\r\n　スフォリアがはきはきとしゃべるのに、世界のためねえ、と内心で復唱した。\r\n　「そこでお前には見せてやってほしいのだ。今までの名ばかりの\"式典\"ではなく、フィアデンは世界を『扱える』のだと言うことを。」\r\n　「………」\r\n　辺りの従者を見回す。彼らは王に同意するように頷いて聞き惚れていた。\r\n　「…下らないな。」\r\n　「…何？」\r\n　クノーテンは手を肩まであげて首を振った。\r\n　「なんだよ、ここまで待たせといてそんなこと？探って損した。」\r\n　「我らが世界を導き続けることにおいては重要なことだ。芽を摘むのは早い方がいい。」\r\n　ぴりりと空気が張る。少年は彼らに囲まれていることも気にしないように否定を続ける。\r\n　「昔ヒトビトの本読んだけど…似たような物が載ってたよ。要するに、世界を支配したいんだろ？」\r\n　「そんなことと一緒にするでない。」\r\n　「同じだよ。\"俺\"にとっては…なあ、セーレン？」\r\n　クノーテンの横に光が集まる。光は呼ばれた少年の形を取った。同時にクノーテンの衣服も変わり、彼らは正装で並んで微笑む。\r\n　「クノーテン…」\r\n　「そこにいろよ。すぐ終わるから。」\r\n　ざわつく部屋のなかでスフォリアだけが「何のつもりだ」と聞き返した。\r\n　「あんたが置いたんだろう？私の部屋に。その文献らにはこう書かれていたよ。『フィアデンは世界そのもの。世界の顕現態…』」\r\n　「そうだ。世界の安寧を守り続けるために、我らは…」\r\n　「だったらどうして、『わからない』んだ…？」\r\n　呟いたのはセーレンであった。\r\n　「声…とは少し違うけど、思いがわからない、聞こえないんだろ、あんたたちは。」\r\n　誰も反論も質問もしなかったが、明らかに彼らの表情は\"何のことだ\"と言っていた。\r\n　「ははは…まあつまり、定義でいけばお前たちはフィアデンではないって訳だ。」\r\n　「…ふざけるのもいい加減にしなさい。」\r\n　黙るようスフォリアは攻撃したがクノーテンの元へ来る前に打ち消される。そのまま例の粒をひとつ、摘まんだ形の指の間に出現させるともう一度声を出して笑った。\r\n　「これさ、印をつけた力を吸い込むんだよな。そして私はこれを…アインの食事に混ぜた。」\r\n　「―！」\r\n　そこにいた\"フィアデン\"の誰もが、できる限り平然を保とうとして口を寄せた。\r\n　セーレンだけが首をかしげる。\r\n　「どういうことだ？」\r\n　「私らに食事はいらないけど、あいつらには必要ってことだよ。まあ、そうだよな。それが一番吸収しやすいし、他の\"生き物たち\"も納得しやすい。」\r\n　少年はいまいちピンときていないようで眉を寄せる。\r\n　「…いつから気づいていた？」\r\n　「さあ？初めはやけに\"修行\"に拘るなと思ってた程度だったさ。私は力を得て一度だって暴走してないのに慎重だなと。…けど、あれの目的は『俺』の魔法を取り出すことだったんだよな。」\r\n　スフォリアは険しい表情のまま、どこか自分が正しかったと主張するように双子と対峙した。クノーテンは続ける。\r\n　「…よくは知らないけど、まあ種族的にはあんたらは\"フィアデン\"だったんだろう。けど、いつの頃からか世界のことがわからなくなって、魔法も扱えなくなっていた。…そんなとき現れたのがセルミアーデンだ。それはいとも簡単に世界と同期して見せた。」\r\n　とことこと、周囲を歩きながら―まるで従者らの動きを牽制するように―同情するように言葉を紡いだ。\r\n　「だからあんたらはセーレンの力を吸出して自分達が魔法を使っているかに見せたんだ。どうせこいつなら使われた力が戻るからな。」\r\n　あ、そうだと彼は王を指差す。\r\n　「誤解されないように言っとくけどこいつは別に力が制御できなかった訳じゃない。」\r\n　「…何？」\r\n　スフォリアは受け答えたものの、そこに多くの感情は存在していなかった。ただこの状況をどうすべきかだけに考えがまわる。\r\n　「こいつができなかったのは感情の制御さ。やりたいと思ったことをうまく抑え込めなかったんだ。…あいにく私は誰かさんのせいで我慢にはなれてたからね。」\r\n　くすくすクノーテンは嘲り、おなじようにくすくすとセーレンも笑っていた。\r\n　「…で、お前は何をするつもりだ。」\r\n　「決まってるだろ。」\r\n　少年は表情から笑みを消す。そうして冷たさもない無を向けた。\r\n　「お前らに『世界《おれ》』は渡さない。」\r\n　一歩、無意識に従者らはさがった。\r\n　「………………」\r\n　\"フィアデン\"の王は目をつむる。しばらく黙りこんで、しかし次の言葉は無様にも脅しであった。\r\n　「…逃げ切れるのか？我ら全員…いや、生き物全てから。いくらお前たちと言えど、それは――ッ！」\r\n　彼は冷や汗を隠すように笑顔を張り付けていたが、そのことに気づくと慌てて指を彼らへ向ける。\r\n　「捕らえよっ――」\r\n　そんな言葉が、空しく響いた。\r\n　\r\n　青黒い岩の隙間を光が走っていった。それは岩と岩の境なのか、光がそれらを分断させたのかはわからない。そんなことはどうでもいいのだ。\r\n　クノーテンは\"拒否\"を行うと、ステージの中央へ頭を向けて、セーレンとは対称になるように体を横にした。\r\n　彼らはぼーっとその体勢で見上げている。ときたま相づちをうった。\r\n　「……うん、そっか。」\r\n　「…おまえがそうするなら、それで。」\r\n　そこは彼だけがいられる空間。『それ』である彼らだけが、そこでの存在を許されるのだ。セーレンはそれとの会話を終え、視線はそのままに声を出した。\r\n　「ねえ、クノーテン。」\r\n　「なんだ？」\r\n　片割れは優しく返事をしてくれた。\r\n　「…ありがとう。」\r\n　「え…」\r\n　ぎゅっと目を瞑る。\r\n　「本当は、洗脳されたのだって演技だったんでしょ？」\r\n　「…なんで。」\r\n　「クノーテンは、俺を助けてくれたんだ。ずっとその機会を伺ってたんだ。」\r\n　「んなわけねーだろ。成り行きだ。」\r\n　突き放すようなクノーテンの言葉に、彼はくすりと笑う。\r\n　「わかるよ。私《おまえ》は俺の大好きな俺だもの。」\r\n　「私は俺《おまえ》が大嫌いなんだ。助けるわけないだろ。」\r\n　「あはは、俺のくせに。」\r\n　「お前のほうこそ。」\r\n　一瞬だけ間があいて、重なった笑い声が響いた。`","export

`\\\r\n　その日もなんということのない日常のはずであった。\r\n\r\n　彼はいつものように、ヒトビトやコレンのこどもらと遊びに出かけていた。トトクレッタでチーム戦をしたり、ミビの欠片で絵を描いたり…そうして夕刻になって、みなそれぞれ家へ帰っていくのだ。\r\n　クノーテンもまた屋敷の方へと歩みを進めていった。\r\n　この時間なら玄関は開いている。彼には開けられぬ壁がおさまる”枠”をくぐれば、大きな階段だけが迎えてくれる。\r\n　そこらを歩いたり話し合ったりするフィアデンが幾らかいたが、誰も挨拶をしない。見る素振りさえなかった。そのあとすぐに帰ってきたクノーテンのキョウダイ…アインへは我先にと頭を下げたというのに。\r\n　―それも、彼の日常であった\r\n　少年は面倒見は良いし、聞き分けも年の割には良い方だろう。わがままも文句も、大人達へ漏らしたことはない。一緒に遊んでいる子供らはそんな彼を好いて頼っていた。彼自身も、意識して良い子にしていた。邪魔にならないように、役割をもらえるように。自分のことは二の次にして。\r\n　それが逆効果だったのか無意味だったのかは定かではないが、フィアデンは極度に彼を差別していた。大人がそんな風だから、フィアデンのこどもも彼を忌み嫌っていて、キョウダイ意外に口をきいてもらえたことさえない。\r\n　初めて会った相手でも、彼を仲間に入れることはしなかった。次第に彼の方から求めなくなった。\r\n　そんな少年へ遊ぼうと誘ったのは、ヒトビトやコレンの子供達。彼らは身分も種族も関係なく、ただ純に彼を受け入れた。\r\n　―今でもよく覚えている。無邪気な笑みは、ひどく眩しかった。\r\n　\r\n　歩いて行けるところに、彼の部屋はある。最後の情けのような何もない小さな部屋。本当に、ただ空間と言うだけの、部屋。\r\n　例え何か文句を言ったところで、誰も聞き入れてはくれないのだろう。理由はわからない。ただずっとそうであったから、そういうものなのだ。そうと受け入れるしかない。親も、少年には見向きもしなかった。\r\n　双子のキョウダイであるセーレンに対する扱いは真逆だった。元々キョウダイ意外とは遊ぼうともしなかった彼だから、その才能を発揮し出すとすぐに王に呼ばれて皇子としての役目を、仕事を期待され、こなしていった。\r\n　自分と彼は本当によく似ていたのに。彼だけがそのように存在を望まれる…それだけはどうしても受け入れられなかった。世の似たものは一緒にされることを嫌うと言うが、彼は一緒にもされないことに納得ができなかった。決して彼になりたかったわけではない。ただ、機会さえももらえなかったことに憤りが隠せない。確かにセーレンはとてつもなく魔法《フェル》の扱いがうまかった。それでも、お前はどうかと一度は試すのが普通じゃないのだろうか。\r\n　冷たい床に座って、左の手のひらを見つめる。中央から渦を巻くように、奇妙な黄の模様が交わることなく胸まで続いている。他のどのフィアデンにもない、魔法を封印する禁忌術。彼も覚えていないほどの頃、親である王にかけられたものであった。だから彼は、魔法を扱ったことがなかった。\r\n　昔、やけになって剥がして、つぶして焼いたこともあった。けれども”ウチガワ”にまでびっしりと張り巡らされたそれは、痛みだけを残して嘲るように居座り続けていた。\r\n　部屋の前に何者かの気配がする。わかっている、セーレンだ。\r\n　「…クノーテン」\r\n　「入ってくるな。」\r\n　「どうして…？最近、会ってもくれない…」\r\n　そんな彼の元へわざわざ尋ねてくるのは彼しかいない。セーレンだけは優しかった。彼を避けることは勿論、嫌がることをしないし、どれだけ苛ついていて行き場のない憎悪を向けられても少年を見捨てることなく、こうして気にかけてくれていた。けれどもそのときのクノーテンにとって、ひどく苦しいことだった。彼が、全てから求められる彼から気遣われる自分が、クノーテンの方が年上のはずであるのに、ひどく惨めに思えてしまって。\r\n　セーレンはそう、と静かに呟き、おそらくは自分の部屋へと帰っていった。\r\n　―セーレンは、何も悪くないだろう…！それなのに、私は…\r\n　悪いのは努力も才能も足りない自分の方。そう、思わなければいけなかった。こんな格好悪いままで、いたくなかった。\r\n　\r\n　そろそろ、”ゴハン”の時間だろうか。\r\n　床にそのまま寝転がって、クノーテンはぼうとそんなことを考える。彼には関係のないことだけれど、なんとなく考えてしまうのだ。親が、キョウダイが、一体どんな話をしながら食事するのだろうかと。\r\n　食事は、一度だけしたことがあった。大きな机に光る黒い布が皺一つなく敷かれ、紺と銀の食器が並べられている。器具を両手に持ち、食物を口へと運ぶ、その一連の整った動作に感動した。\r\n　セーレンが、彼がいかないなら行きたくないとわがままを言ったために実現したことだった。王が今回だけだと珍しく折れたのだ。そうなるとは、クノーテン自身が一番想像していなかっただろう。\r\n　初めての食事は、緊張と新鮮さで高揚感に満ちていた…が、それもそう長くは続かなかった。すぐに他のフィアデンらの視線が気になって居心地が悪くなって、あろうことかその場で、見よう見まねで口へと入れた物をはき出してしまったのだ。口から栄養を取るということに慣れていなかったせいもある。\r\n　以降、セーレンがいくらごねても許されることはなかった。クノーテンも屈辱と罪悪感で二度とそんな贅沢はしないと断った。\r\n　\r\n　再びセーレンが尋ねてきた。\r\n　「クノーテン。ごめんね。俺が悪いんだ。謝る。もうしないから。…だからお願い、良いって言って。会いたいよ。また、遊ぼうよ…」\r\n　クノーテンは声のする方へ背を向けるように寝返りを打つ。\r\n　「…フィアデンなんかそこらにいるだろ。お前なら、喜んで皆構ってくれるじゃないか。…もう、私に構わないでくれ。気にしなくていいから。」\r\n　「そんなの嫌だ…！クノーテンはどうしてそんな酷いことができるの？！俺の…こと、きら…い、なの…？」\r\n　セーレンは、普段はどんなことも淡々とこなす。そのとき、クノーテンは気づけたはずであった。このように彼が弱音を吐くなど、ただ事ではないと。\r\n　「…ああ、嫌いだよ。うざいんだ。いちいち構ってきてさ。」\r\n　その言葉は決して本心というわけではなかった。むしろ、そうしてセーレンが自分に構わなくなればますますフィアデンから重宝され、それがフィアデンの、彼のためなのだと自分の中の何もかもを殺して、自分に言い聞かせているつもりで……\r\n　ざわり、と空気が歪んだのに驚いて、クノーテンは起き上がる。\r\n　が。\r\n　「そう…なんだ。ごめんね。」\r\n　彼は”いつものように”とぼとぼと自分の部屋へと帰っていき、杞憂だとため息をついてまた寝転がった。\r\n　本当の地獄は、そこから始まった。\r\n　\r\n　早朝、親が彼の元へ尋ねてきた。セーレンやアインと遊んでいる途中でも、皆を呼ぶことは今までになく、ましてや自分のみに用事があるなど初めてのことだったから、彼は浮かれて期待に瞳を輝かせていた。\r\n　「…お前に仕事ができた。お前にしかできないことだ。」\r\n　その言葉に―たとえそこには蔑むような調子が含まれていたことに気づいていても―喜びを隠せなかった。\r\n　「ほんとう？！私、何でもするよ。きっと応えてみせるから…」\r\n　胸を充実感でいっぱいにして、親子は廊下を歩いて行く。王と連れだって歩く日が来るなど、自分だけが必要とされることなど、夢物語だと。\r\n　やがて小さな部屋につく。少年の使っていた部屋より２周りくらいは大きいが、館の他の部屋と比べれば小さい方だろう。\r\n　何をするのだろうか。この大きさでは、満足に走り回ることもできはしない。かといって、机も何も、そこにはなかった。\r\n　クノーテンはやや不審に思いながらも、きっと王のことだとおそるおそる振り返る。そうして、内容を聞こうとした時だった。\r\n　彼の後ろから、数体のコレンが入ってきた。少年は思わず驚きの声を漏らす。\r\n　「本当に、好きにして良いんですか？」\r\n　「ああ、いくらでも。」\r\n　「ありがとうございます、スフォリア様…」\r\n　「ちょ、ちょっと、とうさん…？」\r\n　少年の問いかけには何も答えず、王はその場から姿を消す。残されたコレンが、「好きにできるって」「やりぃ！」「おれ、一度フィアデンとやってみたかったんだ…」などと口々に呟いている。\r\n　背に冷や汗が流れた。なぜなら彼らの足には、ルールを破った者の証が刻まれていたからだ。おそらく、良い仕事ではない。\r\n　「さあ、どうしてやろうか？」\r\n　「よし、とりあえず僕らと同じ姿になって貰おう」\r\n　彼らはじりじりと妖しい光でクノーテンへ詰め寄る。なんとか逃れようと言い訳を考えるのだが、\r\n　「ま、ってよ…私は魔法使えないから…」\r\n　などと、そこまで暴露して、まずかったと口を押さえる。\r\n　「はは、本当に魔法使えないんだ。」\r\n　「何しても抵抗もできないか？」\r\n　また、彼らが近づく。それからは頭が真っ白になって、自分が自分でなくなって、されるがままだったのに、その一つ一つをしっかりと記憶していた。早い話どうしようもない欲望のはけ口が彼の役割であった。\r\n　単に暴力をふるわれたこともあった。理解しがたいような方法で屈辱を受けたり、変な薬草でおかしくされたこともあった。持ち込むのもやり方も自由で、嗜好はそれぞれで、同じ苦しみは二度なく、毎日怯えて暮らすしかなかった。しかし、存在的にはフィアデンである彼は、他の種族からどれだけ弄ばれようと、どんなものを摂取させられようと…何をされようと、物理的に壊れることはなかった。破損箇所はしばらくすれば元通りになってしまう。このときほど、自分がフィアデンであることを憎んだことはなかった。\r\n　\r\n　―どうして。何がきっかけで、こんなことになってしまったのだろうか\r\n　その日も、散々な扱いを受けて疲れ切って、ただひとつ床にころがっていた。他にすることはない。彼らが出入りする時だけ、廊下との境界が姿を現す。魔法を使えない彼に、その扉を開くことはできなかった。\r\n　逃げ出すことを考えもできずに、ぼーっと、あの日を回想する。特にこれといって特別なことはなかった…と思う。セーレンには少し辛く当たってしまったか。\r\n　―だから、反感を買った？\r\n　すぐにそれはないと否定する。確かにセーレンはフィアデンの間で最も大切とも呼べる”存在”であったが、彼はとても自分勝手で協調性もなく、多くの者がうんざりしていた。彼が必要とされていたのはその類い希な力。彼がどれだけ不満を漏らしても、その対象への仕返しなど、考えもしないだろう。彼とは違う意味でかわいがられているアインならともかく。\r\n　その体勢が辛くなって、右側を下にするべく力を加えようとする…そのときであった。\r\n　天井に光があふれ、やがて一つの形を取っていく。それが片割れと気づいた頃には、セーレンはクノーテンを抱きしめていた。\r\n　「クノーテン！」\r\n　「せ、セーレン？！どうしてお前が…」\r\n　コレンやヒトビト、これだけならず者がいるのかと多くの者がこの部屋へやってきたが、フィアデンがここへ来ることはなかった。罰されないわけではない。その手の欲望が、彼らにはないのだ。\r\n　「助けにきたんだよ…！」\r\n　「え―？」\r\n　助けに来た。クノーテンにはその意味がしばらく分からず黙っているとセーレンがはっとして悲しそうに少し距離を置いた。\r\n　「あ…ごめん、俺なんか嫌いだったね。余計なことだよね…」\r\n　「そ、そうじゃない。ちょっと混乱してただけで…私の方こそ、ごめん。意地になってて、酷いことを…」\r\n　「本当？俺のこと、嫌いってのは…」\r\n　「もちろん嘘だよ。その方が良いと思って…私なんか、一緒にいちゃいけないと思って…」\r\n　セーレンは安心してほっと胸に手を当て、嬉しさを抑えきれずに笑顔を見せる。が、すぐに表情を変えるとクノーテンへと向き直る。\r\n　「…って、こんなことしてる場合じゃない。行こう、クノーテン」\r\n　「行くって…どこへ。」\r\n　「ここから出て行くんだよ。クノーテンにこんな事して、本当に許せない！」\r\n　―そうか、自分はようやくこの役割から解放されるのか\r\n　そこでやっと「助ける」に納得がいって、彼はなんて優しいのだろうと今度はクノーテンがその手にキョウダイを抱えた。\r\n　「え―？くの、てん…？」\r\n　「ありがとう、セーレン。」\r\n　安心したら、なんだか涙が溢れてきた。もう、限界だったんだな。そんなのんきなことを考えていた。\r\n　彼の助けると、彼の助けられるが同じかどうかなど、分からなかったというのに。\r\n　「……っふ、ふふっ…」\r\n　セーレンが不気味に笑って、涙も拭わずに顔の見えるくらいに体を離す。\r\n　「…どうした？」\r\n　「ううん。…泣いたところも好きだよ。」\r\n　彼はにこりと笑顔を作る。\r\n　「なんだよ、それ…」\r\n　セーレンはもう一度何でもないよと首を振る。そうしてその場へは代わり身人形を置いて、クノーテンを連れて出て行った。\r\n　セーレンに連れられ、少年は光を見ていた。きっと外は眩しいだろう。ずっと薄暗い部屋に希望もなく籠もりきりで…さあ、何をしようか。日の光を体いっぱいにあびて、爽やかな草原をくたびれるまで走り回って、それから、それか、ら…\r\n　………？\r\n　しかし、彼の当然と思っていた光景とはかけ離れた世界が、転移の先に広がっていた。\r\n　\r\n　部屋…だろうか。四方を”何か”に囲まれて、しかし先程よりもだいぶゆったりと広い空間。煌びやかだが落ち着きのある机や寝床。ひらりと舞ったカーテンの先には何もない。\r\n　館にある彼の部屋？\r\n　しかしそのようなところでは、すぐにバレて更に酷い罰を受けるのでは……そんなクノーテンの疑問に気づいてかセーレンが優しく囁いた。\r\n　「大丈夫だよ。俺の所有空間だから。誰も入ってなんか来られない。」\r\n　クノーテンは改めてセーレンを見つめる。\r\n　彼の力は規格外だ。例え今この瞬間に世界に存在していない物でも、まるで以前から在ったように今にそれを創り出せる。物であろうが、空間であろうが、概念であろうが……彼にとっては変わらない。\r\n　「そ、そうなんだ。よかった。……でも、できれば外がよかったなぁ。久々に日の光を浴びたい。…なんて、贅沢かな。」\r\n　「や、野外で…がいいの？その、悪くはないと思うけど……」\r\n　―ん？\r\n　セーレンはいいながら照れて顔を隠すように目を伏せる。その反応はおかしくないか？\r\n　何かが噛み合っていないような微妙な不安に眉を寄せながらも、自由を謳歌するべくクノーテンは伸びをした。脱力に腕が揺れ終わるとセーレンが口を開いた。\r\n　「じゃあ、始めようか。」\r\n　何を？と尋ねても、私の方が何を言っているのだと言わんばかりにセーレンは楽しそうに微笑む。ぞっと直感が逃げろと告げていた。\r\n　「掃除だよ。まずは綺麗にしなくちゃ。……他で汚れちゃったクノーテンをさ。」\r\n　彼の瞳に渦が巻く。声音がだんだん冷たくなっていく。クノーテンは気づかれない程度に後ずさり、はったりに彼も笑みを作るのだが、目はまるで笑っていなかった。\r\n　「そ、そうじ……？」\r\n　上ずる声にセーレンはもう一度穏やかな笑みを見せる。が、逃がしはしないとクノーテンの片腕を掴み、反対の手は頬に触れる。\r\n　「ほら、大人しくしててね。大丈夫、俺が全部掻き出して綺麗にしてあげるから…」\r\n　頬に触れた手がそこからずぶずぶと”内”へ入り込んでいく。確かに別の個としてあるのに、溶け出したように自分に一体化していく不快にクノーテンは悲鳴を上げる。今にも白目を剥きそうなほど、痛みよりも気持ちの悪い感覚であった。セーレンは大丈夫、と繰り返し落ち着かせるよう声をかけるが、彼の痙攣は止まることはない。\r\n　それもそのはず、彼の中の閉じこめられていたときの記憶が、屈辱の数々が、奥から外へ出るように誘われ、その上出てくるのを嫌がるかのように留まるものだから、たとえ意識を失ったとしてもその事実を認識させられる程なのだ。\r\n　「いやっいや、っだ…あ”あ”ぁあ”っ？！」\r\n　「大丈夫、俺だから。他という汚れたものじゃなくてさ…痛いのもちょっとだけ。全部なくなったら細かい事なんて忘れちゃえるから。」\r\n　多種多様な言葉、感情、出来事…彼の中に入ってきたいろんなモノが次々と現れては、出て行く。怖くてたまらなかったが、セーレンがこんなことをするのは嫌な事をきちんと忘れさせてくれるためなのだと歯を食いしばって耐えていた。\r\n　やがて、大まかの経緯程度が彼に残ると、そのまま前方へ倒れ込み、セーレンに支えられた。確かに、閉じこめられていたときよりずいぶんと楽になっている。とクノーテンは興奮したままの体を落ち着かせながら思う。なんというか、すっきりしていて、自分が単に自分だと認識できるのだ。ふんわりとした暖かな風に包まれて日光浴をしているみたいに、口に柔らかな感触があって……\r\n　――え？\r\n　はっと目を開ける。かすかに聞こえていた記憶の声に「よく頑張ったから褒美」との賞賛の言葉があるような気がする。\r\n　目の前にはセーレンの顔が、そうであると認識するのが困難なほど大きくあった。いや、近くに来ていたのだ。\r\n　「ん？ンーっ！！」\r\n　自らの口内へあるはずのないものが入り込んで、絡みついて、吸い付いてかき回して、嫌だと直感する以外は何が起こっているのかも分からなかった。\r\n　ようやく解放されて彼は口を拭う。瞳から疑念と軽蔑が窺えた。\r\n　「せー…れん？何を……」\r\n　「ふふ…あまぃ……」\r\n　ゾっと寒気が全身を覆って虹彩が縮まる。セーレンの頬は火照っていた。\r\n　「どうしたの、クノーテン？」\r\n　「お前……一体…」\r\n　「ああ、いきなりだったから驚いちゃったかな。ごめんね？」\r\n　まるで声をかけただけのような当たり前にすり替えようとする片割れに思い切り首を振って強く否定する。そうじゃない、そうじゃない、としばらく壊れたように繰り返し続ける状態にセーレンは口を曲げると、ため息の後に話題を変えた。\r\n　「なあ、気にならないの？どうしてクノーテンがあんなことされたのか。」\r\n　え……とようやく違う文句が彼の口から飛び出る。話を変えるべきではないと分かっていながら、その情報を無視することなどできなかった。\r\n　そんな様子に少年はにこりと笑う、が、すぐにやや顔を伏せて申し訳なさそうに顔を背けた。\r\n　「ごめんね……俺のせいなの。あの夜、会えないのが寂しくて、むかついて、ううん、いろんな感情がわけわからなくなって抑えきれなくなって…気がついたら、周りが…消えて…」\r\n　消え入るような声の代わりにぽろりと少年から涙が零れる。兄姉のようなクノーテンは焦ってそんな彼の頭を撫でた。きっと彼も不本意だったのだろう、説明の続きはクノーテンの胸へと顔を寄せて落ち着いてからだった。\r\n　「そしたらあいつが、スフォリアが、無理にでも抑え込めるようにって…クノーテンを人質にしたんだ。俺が上手くやらないなら、クノーテンを…ならず者の玩具にするって―」\r\n　「え…」\r\n　クノーテンはセーレンの頭から手を離すとやや後ずさる。その音には疑惑が戻っていた。\r\n　あれから彼の元へそのようなモノ達が来なかったとこは1日たりともなかった。それは所詮その程度では、彼は自分を制御できなかったことを意味する\r\n　「違うよっ俺、ちゃんと抑え込んでた！約束を破ったのはスフォリアなんだ…！俺は怒らないように解らなくならないように、…クノーテンのこと大切だもん。必死で抑えたのに……あいつは、お前の所へ奴らを送ることをやめなかった。解放しなかった。本当はただ、自分じゃどうしようもないあいつらを処理させたかっただけなんだ。生き物の欲望を、最も簡単に発散させるにはフィアデンを好きにさせるのが一番だから……」\r\n　「嘘だ！父さんがそんなことするはずがない。」\r\n　セーレンはまっすぐに弁解したが、クノーテンも負けずに返す。確かに自分との関係はよくなかっただろう。けれども悪いわけでもなかった。ただ父は、自分に興味がなかっただけだ。そうでなくとも王はいつだって正しい。そんな彼が、妥協的な解決で済ませたままにするだろうか…？\r\n　「…だから助けに来たんだ。クノーテンが壊れちゃう前に。」\r\n　セーレンはぐっと近づいていって再び抱きしめる。一瞬嫌悪的な戸惑いがあったが、かすかに震えているのが伝わってきて”彼も怖かった”のだと決めつけ頭を冷やして抱きしめ返した。\r\n　「クノーテン…」\r\n　セーレンの甘えるような声が耳に残る。わかっている。誰もこんなことを望んでなんかいない。\r\n　「……っ！？」\r\n　突然下腹部に刺激が走った。\r\n　ようやく落ち着いたところでまた、状況がつかめなくなり、きちんとした”否定”もできずに”その”進入を許してしまう。\r\n　「ひ…あ、が……ッ？」\r\n　「クノーテン…ふふ、誰にも渡さない…」\r\n　恐る恐る覗いたセーレンの瞳にまた、渦が巻いていた。欲が闇を飲み込むように、彼の真実が己の絶望と直感する。けれどもその刺激は、同化する恐怖はいつの間にか快感に変わってしまって、思うように力が入らない。\r\n　―何が起こっている？\r\n　もう何度同じ疑問を持っただろう。彼が恋慕に頬を染めて発した言葉が、図らずもその答えとなってクノーテンを正気に戻した。\r\n　「あっは…クノーテンの中、きもちー…」\r\n　「……やめろっ！！」\r\n　中。\r\n　そうだ、セーレンの一部が自分との融合を始めている。これはフィアデンの…\r\n　生き物の交配に等しい行為だ。違いと言えば、どちらかが強く否定を示せばすぐにでも分離することと、繁栄には特に必要はないことというくらいだろう。\r\n　弾かれるように思わず目を瞑ってセーレンはふらふらと2，3歩後ろへ退いた。\r\n　「お前…ッ自分が何をしているのかわかってるのか！？」\r\n　「なん…で……」\r\n　「これじゃああのときと、あいつらと同じじゃないか！？せっかく消してくれたのに、どうしてこんな……」\r\n　気持ち悪そうに口元を押さえているクノーテンを見ると、少年は反抗も怒りもなく静かに俯くだけだった。\r\n　「そっか。クノーテンのは、そういうんじゃないんだ。」\r\n　何のことかと尋ねても答えは得られない。彼はしんと静まりかえって地面を見つめていた。その顔に光はなかった。もう回りくどいのは面倒くさいと言わんばかりに笑顔を剥がして、クノーテンの手首は縄状の物で拘束される。\r\n　「なっ…」\r\n　「でも大丈夫。すぐにわかるから。」\r\n　そのままぐいと万歳をさせられるみたいに腕を上げさせられ、どこかに固定された音がすると、それ以降大した身動きがとれなかった。\r\n　「誰にも邪魔されないんだ。ゆっくり教えてあげるよ…」\r\n　―恐怖だけが、私を支配した。\r\n`","export

`\\\r\n　鈍い音がして、また右の腕が悲鳴を上げる。痛みに泣いてもやめてくれと懇願しても、彼は蔑んで楽しむように薄く笑うばかりで話を聞いてはくれなかった。\r\n　「ほら、クノーテン。もうわかるよね？」\r\n　何がなにやら、いつまでたってもわからない。ただ痛くて、悲しくて、こんなことは早く終わって欲しいと願うだけであった。\r\n　「いたい…わからない、もうやめて…セーレン……」\r\n　「…だから俺じゃないって。」\r\n　がんと重い石のようなもので腕がつぶされる。聞き飽きた自分の悲鳴が気持ち悪い。\r\n　「クノーテン痛いの嫌いでしょ？悪いことするから痛くなるんだよ？…ふふ、クノーテンは俺以外に触れちゃいけないんだ。」\r\n　「いみ、わかんな…」\r\n　しびれたように感覚がないようで、いつまでも千切れたことを忘れられないほど痛みは続く。今はこうして腕を集中的に攻撃されていたが、始めにつぶされたのは視界だった。\r\n　拘束の後、突然現れた…というよりは創られたコレンの羽に触られて、特に気にもならず放っておいたら魔法で左目を吹き飛ばされた。同じ要領で右目を、ようやくルールを理解した頃には左の腕も跡形もなく消え失せていた。彼は詳しく説明しなかったが、要するにセーレン以外の何かが故意に接触してきた場合には否定しろということらしい。そうしなければどこかしらを傷つけられる。しかし、何でもかんでも否定していると、たまにセーレンが触れてきて、返って酷い仕打ちを受ける。\r\n　もはや痛覚以外の感覚はなかった。視界が戻ったとして、何が触れてきたかなどわかるはずもない。\r\n　「むりだよ！わかんない…」\r\n　「わかるよ。クノーテンは俺以外に触られたくないもんね。」\r\n　何の冗談なのか、何かの訓練なのか。\r\n　ただでさえ嫌な事続きで参っているというのに、どうしてこのようなことを、しかも今までずっと唯一の味方のはずであった彼にされなければならないのか。\r\n　「せーれん…私、疲れてるの。せめて…寝かせて。」\r\n　「勿論、これが終わったらね。ほら、これは何が触ってるかな…？」\r\n　幾ら考えても、いや、もう考えることもまともにできはしないのだ。遠回しに目的を果たそうとするにしても、あまりにも効率が悪い。\r\n　黙り込んでいたから、またぶたれる。\r\n　「ダメだよ、クノーテン。頭で考えるからわからないんだ。感じればいいんだよ。…ほら、俺が触ると嬉しいでしょ？興奮するだろ？」\r\n　何を言っているのだと未だ見えない目で方向だけ合わせる。と、正面から顔をしっかりと捕まれて直接悦を注入された。\r\n　「＃％”＋！＊｀P#$\"？！」\r\n　並には受け止めきれない膨大な快楽がこの身を駆け抜ける。突き落とされた死体のように飛びはね、やがて静かにその場へ転がった。\r\n　「これが俺だよ、クノーテン……」\r\n　「……………」\r\n　戻りかけた視界に、ぼやけて自分と同じ微笑み顔が見えた。\r\n　\r\n　あれ程疲れていたというのに、解放されてしばらくした今でも上手く眠れなくて、むしろ冴えた頭の中に色々なことがぼーと掛け巡るのは、セーレンが体を密着させたまま眠ってしまったせいだ。たったそれだけで、びくびくと体が興奮のためいうことをきかなくなる。\r\n　あれからそのような状態となるまで、そう時間は要さなかった。\r\n　隣で眠るきょうだいは、先程までの闇を潜め心地よさそうに静かだ。\r\n　結局その行為への理由は聞き出せていない。が、思い出せばセーレンは”掃除”だと言っていた。単に記憶を消すだとか、辛い物を吐き出そう、などではなく。掃除とは、また汚れる可能性があるから、一度綺麗にしておくという行為だ。\r\n　それは、つまり――\r\n　そこまで考えて、少年は首を振った。違う。今考えるべきはそんなことではない。どうにかしてここを抜け出すべきだ。もうあの地獄からは逃れられた。後は戻るだけだ。後は……\r\n　無論自分勝手に対する後ろめたさがないわけではない。動機や原因はともかく、今回の事態を決めたのはセーレンではない。むしろ彼は必死に感情を抑え、一族を裏切って攫ってまで助けようとしてくれた。そのことには確かに感謝をしている。けれども。\r\n　―私が望んでいるのは、こんな場所じゃない。\r\n　起こさないようにそっと、表層の欲望に抗って布団を抜け出す。クノーテンがルールを体で理解したためか、すでに拘束は解かれてふんわりとした布に包まれていた。\r\n　一つ伸びをして凝り固まった体をほぐす。終わり際手を下げながら辺りを見渡すが、どこにも扉はなかった。こうなると、彼にはどうしようもない。\r\n　クノーテンはもう一度セーレンを見る。あんなにも気軽に話しかけられていたのが嘘みたいに、うまく声がかけられない。それは、気持ちよさそうに眠る子を起こしたくはないなどと言う優しさからではなく。\r\n　…ずっと、ひとつの嫌な予感がある。何度拭い去っても消えずに輝き続ける可能性。とても、とても嫌な……\r\n　\r\n　―逃げて、どうなるというのだ。\r\n　ふと、そんな言葉が頭をよぎった。それはなんとか決心をつけて「ここから出して欲しい。」と彼にお願いしようと声を出す手前であった。思い出してしまった情景から連想されるこれからが、冷静になったのかあまりにも悲惨であったのだ。それは明るい花畑などではない。\r\n　自分に居場所はない。フィアデンは考えるまでもないが、彼らが導くと息巻き、また彼らを迷いなく慕うヒトビトやコレンも今ではどのような知恵を与えられているのかわからない。とにかくあんな場所から出られればそれまでの状態が待っていると思っていたが、本当に”そのまま”でいてくれているのだろうか。…光塊のこども達に、慰みと化した自分という存在の記憶が必要か？\r\n　父は…王はフィアデン、生き物全てから慕われるのが納得できるほど優しくて善い君主だ。種族など関係ない。できないを補うのみで、見下したり驕るようなことなどしない。不要な、それどころかマイナスになりかねない記憶など、ない方が皆のためになる。だから彼は、きっと何の迷いもなく。\r\n　クノーテンの価値など、その程度であった。少なくとも彼自身はそう確信していた。普段のあの優しさは、自分を前にすると影も形もなく辛辣な対応をする。そして王がそうであったからこそ、きょうだいとして育ったアインやセーレン以外のどのフィアデンもが彼をそのように扱うことに疑問を持たなかった。\r\n　悪いのは自分が存在すること。それをどうしようが、構わない。\r\n　噛み締めた口の代わりに目元が熱くなる。どんな快楽を与えられても、安全を保証されても、決して満たされはしない。そう、私が欲しいのはそんなものじゃない。見せかけで偽りで、その場しのぎの喜びなんかじゃ足りない。\r\n　「泣いてる……？」\r\n　弱々しい自分の声に驚いて顔を上げる。それはよく似た双子の声であった。彼はいつも通りの大人しい佇まいで座っていた。少年の驚きはその、突然の音と彼の彼らしさからくるものだったが、片割れはそうとらなかったのかゆっくりと歩みを進めてクノーテンの頬に手を伸ばした。わずかに肩が震えたが、彼も大人しいものであった。\r\n　「クノーテン、悲しいの？」\r\n　「…ああ、空しい。私は…必要がない。」\r\n　うつろな瞳にほんの少し嫌疑の光が映る。そんなことを言ったらまた、おかしくなって自分だけ居ればいいだろうだとか締め付けられるのではと思い出したからであった。が、彼はそれ以上妖しい言動は見せなかった。\r\n　「どうして泣いているの…？」\r\n　だから、とあふれたのは言葉よりも涙だった。目の下に溜まっていたものがあふれ出して、力が抜けて膝を折る。ただただ、悲しかった。当たり前のことが、日常が、帰りたいはずだった場所が、悲しかった。\r\n　「ちがう……私はあそこに帰りたいんだ。慰めるための小部屋でも、お前の創った世界でもない。日常に……」\r\n　「なぜ？ここは素敵なところだよ。何でもあげる。友達も、家族も、クノーテンの欲しいものは全部あげる。…痛いのが嫌なら、我慢するから。」\r\n　「ちがう…ちがうんだ、セーレン。」\r\n　クノーテンはゆっくりと首を横に振る。そうしてようやくセーレンが怒りを表情に見せた。\r\n　彼らの間に彼の意思とは関係なくクノーテンの腕が突き出される。それは奇怪な模様が支配する、左の腕であった。\r\n　「こんなことされて、まだあいつを慕うか…！スフォリアは、お前から全てを奪う…」\r\n　彼は強制力よりも言葉に目を丸めてそれは…と一度は口ごもり戸惑っていたが、\r\n　「前に剥がそうとしてただろ！？存在のウチガワまで念入りに染み込んでいるって…あのときも、泣いていた。…だったら、俺が」\r\n　「やめろ！」\r\n　セーレンの思惑を読んで右の腕で庇うように左手を包み、また首を振る。セーレンの歯ぎしりがやけに響いた。が、クノーテンの悲哀に満ちた笑顔に今にも逆立つように揺らいでいた彼の髪は落ち着いてしまう。\r\n　「消さないで…だめだろ、セーレン……」\r\n　そんな顔で自分の名を呼ばれては、もうどうしようもないではないか。\r\n　「なんで……だって、」\r\n　「ずっと剥がしたいって、思ってた。でもだめだ。今ここでこれを失くしたら、何も残らなくなる。あの方達との繋がりが、何も…ひとつになっちゃうよ。」\r\n　「……なんでそんなこと気にするんだ。おかしいよ、クノーテン。」\r\n　クノーテンにもわかっている。おかしいのはもう彼じゃない。怒るのが普通だ。怒りにまかせて家出をして、ひとつで己が道を進むなり、新たな仲間を作るのが。けれども辛辣な態度や扱いまでもがなくなったら、私は私をどう認識すればいい―？\r\n　「泣かないでよ、笑うなよ。あいつらのせいで。…そんなの、そんなの…ずるい、よ。あいつらは何もしないのに。お前のためにならないのに。それなのに。」\r\n　クノーテンの視界に不思議な景色が映った。涙に歪んだ幻なのかと拭ってみたが、それは目の前に確かにあったのだ。…セーレンが、彼のその泣き顔はきっとこの世界の何よりも”美しかった”。もしかしたら、共感して悲しんでもらえることがあまりにも珍しくて、嬉しさに錯覚しただけかもしれないが、そのときのクノーテンを再び動揺させるには十分であった。\r\n　「せー…レン？」\r\n　「俺はクノーテンと一緒に居たいのに。ただクノーテンと、いられればそれでいいから、何でもするのに…クノーテンは外ばかりを見ているんだ。」\r\n　本当に彼はどうしてこう、自分に拘るのだろうか…？自分こそ、彼に何もしてやれることはない。必要とされる意味が分からない。\r\n　「…いいんだ、もう。私のことなんか放っておいてくれ。」\r\n　「クノーテンは何も解ってない！」\r\n　「わからないよ！！…もうやめてくれ。私を求めるな。私には何もできない。」\r\n　自分の居場所だってろくに得られない。選択肢を与える前に失望させる。\r\n　「そうだ。もうおかしくなってたんだ。ここで客観視してようやくわかった。…っふ、あはは、はははっはは……あはははっ！！」\r\n　「く、クノーテン！？どうしたの、しっかりして。」\r\n　壊れたように笑い続けるクノーテンにセーレンも動揺する。笑っている理由が皆目見当もつかなかった。どうすれば彼が落ち着いてくれるのだろうか。そんなことさえ考えられずに、揺れる自分の心に驚いて、ぎゅっとクノーテンにしがみつく。\r\n　「クノーテン、やだよ、こわれちゃ嫌……」\r\n　逃げようとする彼の意識を見つけ出して離れぬようしっかり掴んで無理にでも引き戻す。彼の心情ではそんな強制的な行動が精一杯だった。\r\n　意識を叩き起こされてクノーテンはキッと片割れを睨んだ。まるで余計なお世話だと、このまま眠って消えてしまいたいと言わんばかりにわずかに残った正常な感情を怒りに変えた。\r\n　\r\n　どうして彼がそこまで求めるのかはわからない。けれども彼がそれを求める限り、自分ではどうしようもない欲望であると、痛いほど理解していた。`","export

`\\\r\n\r\n　それは儚い夢だった。\r\n　\r\n　定期的に行われる祭と呼ばれる行事。ヒトビトやコレンがフィアデンに感謝を示して、フィアデンは彼らにこれからを約束する。暖かで柔らかな木漏れ日のような光に包まれて、誰もが楽しさに笑って、それが常であればと願うけれど、たまにこんな日があるからこそ、普段の忙しさや面倒ごとが許してしまえるのかもしれないと。\r\n　\r\n　それはささやかな希望だった。\r\n　\r\n　そんな景色を、いつも窓の内側から見つめていた。外からは窓があることさえ知られない忘れ去られた部屋に閉じられて、彼はずっと見つめていた。その日だけは、何があってもそこから出てはいけないと、珍しくフィアデンらが自分に向かって告げるのだ。彼はその”命令”が嬉しくて、きょうだいがどれだけ誘っても、こどもらが約束をしようとしても、決して言い付けを破ることをしなかった。誰もそんなことを褒めはしない。慰められることもないが、それも別に構わなかった。\r\n　\r\n　―だってただ、自分がその事象を強く望まれているのだから。\r\n　\r\n　\r\n　「クノーテン、これからは毎日ご飯を食べようね。クノーテンが吐いちゃったのは、いつも食べてなくて慣れてなかったせいだものね。大丈夫、ちょっとずつ食べていけば、今度一緒にご飯食べられるからね。」\r\n　セーレンは優しくにこりと微笑むと、クノーテンの頤を右手で攫う。そうしてそのまま、反対の手の一つの指を彼の口の中へと押し込んで、顔を掴んでいた手で無理矢理、咀嚼するよう促した。すんでの所で彼が反射的に力を加えたために少年の繊細な指へ傷がつくことはなかったが、セーレンはいい顔をしなかった。\r\n　言葉だけ聞けば、まあその通りなのだが、彼の言動は正気の沙汰とは思えない。\r\n　クノーテンの困惑したような表情から何かに気がついたのか、これじゃ食べにくいかなどと呟くと今度は自らで指を食いちぎり、再び少年の口へとあてがう。\r\n　「な、何してんだ、ばか…ンぐ…」\r\n　彼に捕らえられては抵抗など能力的に敵うはずもなく、ぐいぐいと押し込まれたその指を、ついには飲み込んでしまった。\r\n　「えへへ、おいしい？」\r\n　「う、ええ…」\r\n　ひらひらと欠けた手のひらを見せつけながらまた嬉しそうな顔の彼を見て、信じられないと睨んだのは一瞬で、すぐに味などを認識する以前の不快さでそれはすんなり吐き出て行く。\r\n　「やっぱりまだ慣れないんだね。」\r\n　「そういう問題じゃ…っひ…」\r\n　セーレンはよしよしと頭を撫でると、自らの一部であったクノーテンの嘔吐物を丁寧にすくい上げ、そのまま口へと運んでいって飲み干してしまう。クノーテンの言い分は、そんな異様な光景を目の当たりにして引っ込んで行ってしまって、足はがくがくと震えている。\r\n　「ふふっ、でもクノーテンの吐いた物って、おいしいな。」\r\n　―違う。\r\n　「それも俺の指なんだ。っふふ、ふふふ…嬉しいな、こんな日が来るなんて」\r\n　やはりセーレンなんかじゃない。目の前の”それ”は、きょうだいの、彼の皮を被った化け物だ。\r\n　恐怖からか拘束魔法でも働いていたのか、体は全く動かなくて、じりじりと近づいて口づける少年から逃げることなどできなかった。口内へ、苦いような甘いような不可思議で、とにかく気持ちの悪さだけが明確な味が広がる。名残惜しむように絡まれた舌で、どちらがその味を持ち込んだのか分からなくなるほど掻き回されて、クノーテンはまた無を吐き出した。\r\n　「はい、朝ごはんおしまい。じゃあ、俺は仕事に行ってくるね。」\r\n　少年はひらりと手のひらを揺らす。すでにその手には指が正しく揃っていた。\r\n　\r\n　あれからしばらくそんな生活が続いていた。セーレンだけがこの世界に出入りできるようで、逃げることもできなければ助けが来ることもない。―そんな人物がまだいるかは別として。\r\n　退屈さと逃避によって脳裏をよぎったのは過去の記憶。諦めたと思っていた、自分には何もできないと分かってはいたけれど、それでも彼の夢で、憧れだったのだ。\r\n　フィアデンに、父に…すべてのものにただ自分が”自分”としての存在を許される、認められること。それは決して、大切に扱って欲しいだとか、普段フィアデンがヒトビトやコレンからされているように崇めて敬って欲しいだとか、そういうことではない。誰かから固有の認識を得て、胸を張って自分はこうであると言えるような確信が欲しかったのだ。\r\n　―だから。\r\n　例えどんな指示だろうと受け入れてきた。命令されることは強く彼に”自分”を認識させたから。内から眺めるだけの世界が寂しくても、慰めるための道具になり果てても、それは、嬉しいことのはずだったのだ。\r\n　―なのに、自分はそれ以上の好待遇を望んだ。少しでも”助かる”に納得をしてしまった。そらみろ、外へ出たらこんな固有世界にひとつぼっち。誰も居ない。あいつの用意した物しかここにはない。彼がどれだけ生き物を創っても、自分のためにだけ用意されたそれでは、いないに等しい。王に大人しく従っていればよかったのだ。\r\n　理由は分からないが、どうしてかセーレンにだけはどれだけ”自分”を望まれてもその欲望は決して満たされなかった。誰でも構わない慰み者として求められる方が遙かに望みに近い。双子だから、きょうだいだから、がついてまわるせいなのかもしれない。ただ環境から気に入られているだけで、妥協のような、哀れみのようなものを感じて、究極的にそれは自分ではない、からなのだろうか…。\r\n　\r\n―ああ、なんてつまらないところだろう。\r\n\r\n普段は使われない見かけばかりのステージ上でひとつため息をつく。\r\n白い布はひらひらと鬱陶しくて、そうだと知っていても、認めたくないほどくだらない場所の一つ。端に座り込んで紛らわしに足をぱたぱたと上下させてみた。\r\n「少しは皇子としての自覚を持ったらどうだ。セーレン。」\r\n醜くて不快な音。不必要に低くてねっとり遅くて…ああ、クノーテンの声が聞きたい。あの、透き通ったように気持ちのいいかわいい音。笑い声や泣き声や、羞恥と苦悶を混ぜた複雑で端整よりも美しい感情。きっと\"俺\"では出せない素敵な音。\r\n「聞いているのか。」\r\n苛立ちを悟られぬように隠し、不快な音が続く。相手にしたくないことくらい察してほしいものだと少年は一度目を閉じる。\r\n「うるさいな。休憩くらいいいだろ。」\r\n「ふぅ…その心構えが全くなっていないというのに。」\r\n振った首が小さな風を起こす。そんな仕草さえも彼には不満の要因になる。\r\nどうでもいい。そんな程度のことは。\r\n「俺は、誰にどう思われたって構わない。」\r\n「そんな態度でいいのか？お前がしっかり役割を果たさぬのなら、”あれ”の保証はできないな。」\r\n「……」\r\n光に踊っていた布はやがて静かに台の端の側に落ち着いた。にやりと口角を上げた王はそれでいい、と聞こえぬほど小さな声で呟くと何も知らぬままその場を後にする。\r\n奴らを消し去ることなど造作もない。けれどもそれは自分の信条に反する。邪魔だと思うモノ、好きじゃないもの。そんなもの達のために力も意識も向けるだけ無駄じゃないか。どうでもいいことなのだ。俺は、”それ”だけを見ていたいのだから。\r\nゆっくりと両手で聴覚を覆う。落ち着いて、思い出す。大丈夫、今あの子は自分の側に居る。そうしたじゃないかと言い聞かせるために。\r\n\r\n＊\r\n\r\nひとしきり暴れきって、元に戻してようやく我に返る。\r\n依然息切れを起こしたような落ち着かない様子で目を丸くしていたが、頭を抱えて膝を折ると、そのまま動かなくなってしまう。\r\n心配するように半身のクノーテンがのそのそと這っていって、目の前に項垂れるきょうだいを哀しそうに見つめ、一間の後にきゅっと背に手を回した。抵抗するような力が加わったが、ひどくささいなものであった。\r\n「大丈夫。大丈夫だから…」\r\n「違う、お前はクノーテンなんかじゃない。」\r\n「……うん、それでもいいから。」\r\n目をそらしたままの顔を無理矢理寄せて優しく口づける。落ち着かせるためなどという善意ではなく、見つめていたら抑えられなくなった欲望からであった。\r\n動機はそのようなものではあったものの、彼のキスはセーレンのそれよりも遙かに上品であった。ただ重ねるだけの別れを告げるような情緒のあるものだ。その程度の違いはある。\r\nすっと離れていく温もりにセーレンは力を緩める。再度尋ねられた確認の言葉に答える気力もないようであった。\r\n\r\n＊\r\n\r\n「ただいま。」\r\nセーレンはようやく解放された嬉しさから満面の笑みでクノーテンへ帰って来たことを告げる。少年の小さな体は僅かに震えたようにも思えたが、顔を向けるどころか起き上がりさえしなかった。セーレンは不思議そうに首をかしげててこてこと顔の見える方へと歩みを進めていく。彼の顔が不安に歪みはじめたのは、ぐったりと無と化した状態を視認してからであった。\r\n「クノーテン？俺だよ。帰って来たよ。」\r\nぺちぺちと頬を叩いたり抱き締めてみたり、キスしてみたり犯したり、腹のあたりを貫いたりあれこれ試すのだが、そのどれにも反射さえ―反発に跳ね返ることはあっても―動きを見せなかった。ただずっと、どこかを見つめている。それに夢中でセーレンのアプローチなぞ気にもならぬと言わんばかりの有り様だったのだ。\r\nざわりと空気がよどむ。いよいよ少年の顔に蒼白さが見え始めた。\r\n「クノーテン…？俺をみテ…？？ねェ、ねえッッ！！」\r\n相変わらず呼び声にも物理的な呼び掛けにも応えはない。やがてセーレンの輪郭がぼやけていって、呆けたままのクノーテンへと近づき包み込んでいく。そのまま彼となって、もっと奥底の外側である、\"核\"とも呼べるモノへとそっと触れた。\r\n「……っっぁッ！？！？」\r\nゆっくりと霧は先程までの個へと戻っていく。さすがの少年も片割れを認識して鋭く睨みつける。\r\n「……はあ、よかった。クノーテン、ただいま…」\r\n「……………………」\r\nしかし、その刺激はあまりにも強すぎたのだ。特に今のような隔離状態の彼には、ここしばらくセーレンだけを感じている彼には、セーレンの行動は彼の考える以上に重くのしかかった。それは言葉も続かないほどの苦しみで、全てから解き放たれたような気楽さだ。\r\n「クノーテン？どうしたの？」\r\n「………………」\r\n再び首をかしげたセーレンの口許へと少年の顔が近づいていく。瞳の奥まで覗けてしまいそうなほどの距離で見つめられて少年のポジティブな焦りは増していった。\r\nと。\r\n「っふふ。…あははっセーレンはかわいいねー。」\r\n「……へ？」\r\n突然のことに理解が追い付かない自分の発したすっとんきょうな声に驚いていれば、きょうだいが逆転したように、甘えるように少年は顔を胸にすり寄せた。\r\n「んんー。セーレン、すきだよ。」\r\n「…俺も、クノーテンのこと好きだよ。けど……」\r\nけれども、今の状況は正直よくわからなかった。それを望んでいたはずなのに確信は持っていたのに、彼の言動が理解できなかった。\r\n「えへへぇ、じゃあもっともっとすきだよ。おれ、セーレンのことあいしてる。」\r\nぞっと寒気が全身を覆っていてもたってもいられずに傍らの\"それ\"を突き飛ばす。少年は混乱して無意識に世界と接続していた。\r\nクノーテンは力を加えられるといとも簡単に転がり落ちる。のそのそと上体だけ這い上がってセーレンをぼーっと見つめていた。\r\n「…セーレン？どこかいたいの？」\r\n「ちがうっちがう……いやだ、こわい……」\r\n「大丈夫だよ、おれがずっとそばにいてあげるから。」\r\n「やめろ、来るな！？お前ハだれだ！？……わたしは……」\r\nあっちへこっちへ掻き回して、ぐるりと回して、きっとすべてのものが落っこちた。けれどもそれくらいじゃ足りなくって、身を屈めて暴れるように誰へともなく助けを請う。\r\nクノーテンはゆっくりと全部を引き上げると別段焦った様子もなく当たり前のように自然な振る舞いでセーレンをその手に抱き締める。\r\nあ…と短い声をあげて、彼の震えもおさまっていった。\r\n―暖かい。心地のいいぬくもり。そうだ、そうじゃないか。\r\n「ありがとう、クノーテン。俺が忘れていたよ。何も不思議じゃないんだ。」\r\n「そうだよ、これはおかしくなんてない。だって……」\r\n彼はふっと目を閉じて、その続きを明確な音にはしなかった。残されたセーレンはひとつ頷くと、丁寧に寝かせ直して、もう一度礼を述べた。`","export const novel = `\\\r\n　散々交わって欲にまみれたあとで再び突き放したのはクノーテンであった。\r\n　彼はそれまでの甘えた様子を駆逐したように冷静な表情を取り戻し、拒絶を示すかのように口に手を当て睨み付ける。\r\n　「…私に何をした。」\r\n　「別になにもしてないよ。ほら、続けようよ。」\r\n　「何の話だ！？離れろ！…私は、もうこんなとこにはいたくない。ここから出してくれ…！」\r\n　言うなり駆け出して、意味の無いことを知っていながら壁のように辺りを取り囲むモノへと、反発するべく攻撃する。慣れきっているようにセーレンはため息をついてまた同じことを問うのだ。\r\n　「出ていってどうするの」\r\n　「決まっているだろう！？外に出たら、外に出た、ら……」\r\n　ガンと一層強い衝撃を境にしんと静まり返る。\r\n　「…私は、必要ないのか…？」\r\n　「知らない。」\r\n　「違うよ、外に出ればいいんだ、そしたら、そしたらっ……」\r\n　おそらくそもそも先がないのだろう。ただ延々と繰り返す。先がないから進まない。\r\n　「いい加減にしてよクノーテン。もう52回目だ。クノーテンが繰り返し同じことをしたって気にしないけど、それは俺に向いてるときだけ。他のこと考えてるのがぐるぐるするの、たまったものじゃないよ。」\r\n　セーレンが見つめれば、見えない手が困惑に項垂れる彼の髪を引っ張るように引き寄せられる。\r\n　彼はぱくぱくと何事かを訴えようとしているようだったが、ついに言葉にはならず抗いきれずにちょこんと隣に座り込む。\r\n　「ねえ、クノーテン。外はそんなに楽しいの？嬉しいの？」\r\n　「…そうだ、嬉しいんだ。命令してもらえるんだ。…外に出ちゃダメだって。」\r\n　まるで会話にならない。今のクノーテンはまともじゃないのだ。自分でも何がしたいのかわかっていないのだろう。過去の記憶の惰性で行動を起こしている。そうしてきっとまた、あっちの子がやってきて、繰り返し、繰り返し……\r\n　「……そんなはずないだろ。」\r\n　しかし、予想に反して彼ははじめてその先を紡いだ。呟きがすきま風のように静かに確かに響く。えっと顔をあげて正面から向き直る最中にも新しい言葉が続いていく。\r\n　―それは我儘で無様な弱音だった。\r\n　「嬉しいはずっ…ないじゃないか……私は、私だって魔法を使ってみたい。魔法で、誰かの役に立って、お願いを聞いて、わがままもたまに聞いてもらって、対等に……命令なんていやだよっ…私を見てよ……」\r\n　「クノーテン……」\r\n　未だにどこかを、他所を見つめるように見上げる片割れをまっすぐに見つめて、しかし不思議と怒りは沸いてこなかった。\r\n　「…そっか、クノーテンぐちゃぐちゃなんだね。ひどいこといっぱいされたから、嫌なこともやりたいことも煩雑で、もう区別もつかないんだね……」\r\n　「ひどい、こと…？」\r\n　「そうだよ。いっぱいされたものね。」\r\n　「…そんなことないよ。いっぱい命令してもらえたら嬉しいんだ。ふふ、私なんかの存在で役に立てることなら、……」\r\n　「もういいよ、クノーテン。そんな強がりはいい。」\r\n　「強がりなんかじゃない！」\r\n　ぱっと払うような大きな動作と共に少年は立ち上がる。二度、三度無意味な否定の言葉を並べてから改めて強い意思を示した。\r\n　「少なくとも、こんなとこでお前に監禁されるよりはましだ！セーレンなんて嫌いだ、もう顔もみたくない！」\r\n　「……そう。」\r\n　喧嘩を期待していたのか、少年は不審さにびくりと揺れてしばらくは伺うように頭を悩ませていた。が、セーレンが興味を失ったようにそっぽを向いたのに彼も大人げなかったかなとまた少し冷静さを取り戻していく。\r\n　「……その、このままでいたっていいことなんかないよ。ちょっと離れた方がいいんだ、私たちは…」\r\n　「クノーテンって、結局全然わかってなかったんだ。」\r\n　何が、と落ち着ききった問いにセーレンも起伏の無い調子で返答する。\r\n　「クノーテンは全てだから、全てがお前を嫌って、お前は俺を嫌ってしまうんだよ。でも全然わかんないんでしょ？」 \r\n　こくりと素直に頷いたのを確認したのか間を開けてセーレンは続ける。\r\n　「…いいんだ。別に知らなくても。……わかった。クノーテン、俺をあげるよ。俺の力も立場も全部あげる。今からお前のものだ。あとはお前が手にすればいい。」\r\n　彼が困惑の表情を浮かべた頃には、そこは平穏な風に揺れる草原だった。\r\n　\r\n　少年が前にたつと、重い扉は愛想笑いを浮かべるように双子を歓迎した。高揚感に満たされて一度は目を輝かせたが、すぐに後ろに控える片割れを思い出して恥ずかしさにやや頭をすぼめる。\r\n　入ったすぐのところでフィアデンらが軽く頭を下げた。良い顔も嫌な顔もせずに彼らを認識して挨拶をしているだけだ。こんなものだったろうかとクノーテンは歩いていく。一体外では何がどうなって今日まであるのかもよくわからなかったが、ひとまず適当に部屋にでも行こうかと行き先を定めて目の前にゲートを作った。\r\n　と。\r\n　「…セルミアーデン様……と、クノータデンス。スフォリア様がお呼びだ。」\r\n　背後から慌てたようにひとつフィアデンが駆け現れて彼らを呼び止めた。クノーテンは一度セーレンを見たが、彼は視線に気づいて手を振る代わりににこりと微笑むだけであった。\r\n　\r\n　「…失礼します。」\r\n　緊張して張りつめた肩を覗かせてクノーテンらはおそるおそる部屋へと入っていく。スフォリアは何事かを片手間に迎え入れた。手には資料らしきものが伺える。\r\n　「あ、あの…」\r\n　「いつから出ていた。お前の仕業だろう、セーレン。」\r\n　王は尋ねかけた子供には見向きもせずに後ろに佇む少年に答えを求めたが、彼は笑顔も怒りも浮かべずにただじっと片割れを見つめていた。\r\n　「…はあ、クノーテン。説明させなさい。」\r\n　「えっと…あの場所からは」\r\n　「お前がする必要はない。セーレンに話すよう言いなさい」\r\n　「なんでっ……」と反射的に顔をあげたものの、常と変わらぬ冷ややかな視線に怒りは冷まされ、顔だけでセーレンを見つめる。目が合うとまた彼は笑っていた。\r\n　「クノーテンが話してくれるよね？俺たちはもう反対なんだから。俺はいない。そうしたら俺はクノーテンだけを見ているんだ。」\r\n　「わかるように説明しなさい。」\r\n　望まれていないことに恐れを抱きながら「その、」と一度むせたように詰まり、一呼吸の後に事情を話す。\r\n　「私とセーレンは立場も力も入れ替えたんだ。だから、セーレンとは…話さなくて良い……」\r\n　きゅっと片腕を握りしめる。それは再度睨まれた視線ではなく、自らそう扱われるべきだと認めているようなもの故だ。セーレンは一度だけつまらなそうな表情でスフォリアに向かった。\r\n　「……お前が決めたことだろう。」\r\n　「理由は。なぜ入れ換えた。」\r\n　つんとそっぽを向いてそれ以上の返事はせぬと示したセーレンに代わって答えようとやや前に出る、が。\r\n　理由はクノーテンにもわからなかった。そもそも一体どういう結論となってセーレンは自分に彼の何もかもをくれたのか、当事者であるはずなのに皆目検討もつかない。\r\n　「セーレンよ、我らを裏切るか。」\r\n　相変わらず\"セーレン\"は王を見向きもしない。その頑固さに観念するとスフォリアはようやくクノーテンに尋ねるごとく顔の向きを変えた。\r\n　「そうじゃないっ……セーレンが私を連れ出したのも、別に…そう、同情しただけだよ。私たちは双子だから、共感しやすいんだ。それで、私の状況を憐れんで、助けて、くれた…だけ。」\r\n　クノーテンの言葉には自信がなかった。というかほとんどが嘘であった。本当はそんなに複雑なものじゃない。最も単純に、ただ側に置いておきたかっただけなのだ。けれども真実は自分もおそらく父も好むところではない。\r\n　「とにかく、裏切るとかそういうんじゃないんだ。よくないと思っただけで。ほら、だからこうしてまたここへやって来た。」\r\n　嘘はあったが、一番大切なところは何も変わらない。セーレンは彼らを嫌がっている訳じゃない。\r\n　「…なるほど。」\r\n　王は一言だけ告げて手の中の資料を片付ける。するりと情報立方体は大人しく消えていった。\r\n　「だから、私は、何をすれば」\r\n　「もう少しましなやり方はなかったのか。」\r\n　どきりとクノーテンの心が揺れる。何の話かと尋ねたい先の王はまた、セーレンを見つめていた。\r\n　「休みたかったのだろう？だからそうして\"身代わり\"に力を貸した。そうならそうと言えば良いものを…」\r\n　―休息？代役…？\r\n　「ち、ちがうよ父さんっ！セーレンは私にチャンスをくれたんだ。私がきちんと仕事をする。セーレンより役立ってみせる。だから、…」\r\n　「必要ない。」\r\n　クノーテンはぱっと手をかざして情景八方面を自分と王との間に映し出す。中では楽しそうにコレン達が集って飲み交わしている。魔法が使えることを証明したかったのだ。まだそのことに疑念を持っていると思っていた。けれども反応はひどく薄く、勘違いだと気づかされる。\r\n　「何度も言わせるな。確かにセーレンは働きづめだったからな。休むのは構わない。しばらくは無しで回せるように整えなければ…」\r\n　更にはひとつ頷くとまた資料を取り出し、計算を始めてしまった。\r\n　「どうしてっ……なんで…？私が…私は……」\r\n　「もう下がりなさい。お前は必要ない。」\r\n　「お前らが欲しいのは力だろっ！？そうなはずだ、お前らが、セーレンを利用するのは……」\r\n　「クノーテン…？それ、どういうこと？」\r\n　明らかに様子のおかしくなったクノーテンを心配してセーレンは駆け寄る。落ち着かせるように背中を擦っても、スフォリアが怒りを向けても彼はぶつぶつとひとつ続ける。\r\n　「セーレンなんかが必要とされるのはそうなはずだ。お前達も魔法を使うために…そうじゃなきゃ、だって…」\r\n　「クノーテン、大丈夫だよ。落ち着いて。」\r\n　「うるさい触るな。気色の悪い手でオレに触れるな。」\r\n　ぎょっと怯えてセーレンでさえ後ずさる。このまま離れてはいけない焦りと逃げたいほどの恐怖との間で1,2歩ではあったが。そうする内にクノーテンはまた王へと向かう。\r\n　「なぜ同じ力じゃいけない？セーレンなんかよりオレは素直に従ってやるよ。あんたらはオレの欲しいものを持ってる。それさえくれれば、何だって…」\r\n　「セーレン、一体連れ出した後クノータデンスをどうしていたのだ。明らかに壊れているぞ、これは。」\r\n　「…わかんない。ねえ、クノーテンどうしちゃったの？クノーテンでも、あの子でもないよ。」\r\n　「別にどうもしてないさ。納得できないんだ。理由がわからないから。…ねえ父さん、どうして私じゃいけないの？」\r\n　そうかと思えば、彼はもう彼らしさを取り戻していた。その様に気迫を取り戻してか、やれやれと首を振ってからスフォリアは止まっていた手をそのまま下ろして双子に視線を合わせるように屈んだ。\r\n　「この際だから話してしまおうか。クノータデンス、お前は存在し得ない存在なのだ。…それが答えだ。」\r\n　「え……？」と理解もできていない光を瞳にともす。何度か瞬きをしてまっすぐ見つめて続きを待つ。対象にセーレンは顔を背けた。\r\n　「私は勿論、どのフィアデンもお前を創ってなどいない。ヒトビトからもコレンからの出生にも記録はない。我らは全ての生を、物の始め終わりを把握しているが、お前はその中に現れず、いつの間にかそうしてセルミアーデンに酷似した姿で隣にいたのだ。」\r\n　「っ……そんな…」\r\n　フィアデンではない。存在は無いに等しい。\r\n　幾度となく教えられたそれは差別や意地悪ではなかった。―真実だった？\r\n　「嘘だ…私は、ここにいるじゃないか。だったら私は何なんだ！？」\r\n　「知るか。…だからこそ、我らはお前を\"認識しない\"ことにした。さあ、わかったらさっさと失せろ。お前に用など無い。」\r\n　どさりと勢いよく膝が落ちる。がくがくと惨めに震えてぶつぶつとまた空の言葉を繰り返す。スフォリアが仕事に戻ろうと踵を返したところで場を支配した怒りは、クノーテンからではなかった。座り込む少年を庇うように立ちはだかって、怒っていたのはセーレンだ。彼がそのように直接他へ明らかな怒りを向けるのは珍しいことであった。\r\n　彼自身も望んでいないことであった。\r\n　「……無駄足だったねクノーテン。ほら、もう帰ろう。」`","export

`\\\r\n　部屋には戯れ言が聞き取りにくい小声で永遠と続けられていた。自分は本当にここにいるのか、とかどこにいるのか、とか下らないことばかり。ようやく自分にもわからぬほどの自信や意思を持ち始めていたのに、他所への依存に逆戻りだ。\r\n　セーレンは何度目かのため息をついて、少し離れて彼を見つめる。あのときからまたずっとこんな調子なのだ。話しかけても触れても自分を認識しない。いい加減耐えられなくなって口を開いた。\r\n　「…そうじゃないよ。ダメになってるのはフィアデンの方なんだ。だからお前を認識できない。」\r\n　「え……？わたしは…いるの…？」\r\n　当たり前だろう、とようやく返された言葉に微笑む。\r\n　「なに…わたしは、なに……」\r\n　「お前はフィアデンだよ。」\r\n　フラフラとクノーテンは立ち上がる。目は座っていない。セーレンの言葉がまだ信じられないように首をかしげている。そんな様にセーレンが近づいていって、もう一度にこりと微笑んだ。彼も微笑み返した。\r\n　「……うそ。」\r\n　しかしセーレンが目の前までやって来たところで、がくりと腰から上の力を抜いたように折り曲がった体勢でクノーテンは続ける。\r\n　「うそだよ。セーレンはうそつきだね。私はフィアデンじゃないよ。……父さんが言ってたじゃないか。」\r\n　「おかしいよ、クノーテン。なんであんなやつの言葉を鵜呑みにするのさ。」\r\n　「うるさいよ！セーレンは嘘つきだ！父さんが正しい…父さん…が…」\r\n　震える肩を見つめるほど、するすると侮蔑が這い上がってくる。張り付けた笑顔が消え始める。どうしてこうも、こいつは…\r\n　「クノーテン酷いよ。だからあいつらが一体お前に何してくれたって言うんだ。何にもしない。必要としない。会話をするのだって嫌だと…」\r\n　「それでもいい！！」\r\n　少年はそのままの姿勢で耳をふさぐ。彼の言葉などもう聞きたくない。ハッキリと拒絶を示していた。その態度を受けて、セーレンが辛くないはずがない。ただ静かに涙が零れる。\r\n　「ずるい…ずるいよ……なんでなの？なんであいつらは、何もしないのにお前に認められるの…？俺の方がいっぱいクノーテン好きなのに…クノーテンだって、俺が好きで堪らないはずなのに…俺は俺である以前に、俺なんだから…」\r\n　が、そこまで言うとピタリと泣き止んでしまう。まるで始めから泣いてなんかいなかったように冷たい瞳で彼を見据えた。もう見向きもしてくれない、否定したままの、彼を。\r\n　「…いいよ。教えてあげる。お前が何物なのか。…どうしてお前が他のすべてを好きなのか。」\r\n　「………………」\r\n　あのね、とセーレンはもう一度だけ返事を待った。けれども彼は相変わらず動じずに耳を塞いでいたから、無理やり腕を引きちぎって前を向かせた。\r\n　「あのね、セーレン…クノーテン、お前は俺なんだよ？」\r\n　暫くの間の後にようやく、は？という理性のある疑問の音が響いて、クノーテンが瞳に輝きを戻す。同時に痛みも認識したのか、固定された肩が僅かに震えた。\r\n　「それで、俺は世界…本当の意味で、俺だけがフィアデンなんだ。……イル、とも言う。」\r\n　「はあ…？」\r\n　言葉の意味が何一つ、意図が全く読めないと先程までとは違うまともな否定を示すクノーテンに、セーレン目を合わせた。と。\r\n　「……！！？…ほら、わかるでしょ。お前は俺なんだよ。」\r\n　自らの口から発された物だと気づくのに遅れるほど、それは当たり前のことだった。\r\n　けど。\r\n　「…っやめろ…今、何した…？」\r\n　信じたくない。受け入れたくなくて、ただ操られているのだと何度も自分に言い聞かせる。そんな彼に再びセーレンは同化する。今までのような実体の、ではなく、存在の同一化であった。\r\n　「わかってるくせに。…やめろっ私から出ていけっ…出るとか出ないとかじゃないよ…嫌だ！！」\r\n　叫びを合図に、今度はセーレンの実体が反論を始める。\r\n　「なんでこんなことを…？！…この方が解りやすいだろ？…何、これ、セーレン？…そう、お前だよ、クノーテン」\r\n　2つはそれまでの2つの実体へと戻ると、クノーテンが腕を取り戻して再び頭を抱えた。嘘だ嘘だと何度も呟きながら、しかし口は笑っていた。\r\n　「だからお前はフィアデンなんだよ。俺と一緒。あいつらはフィアデンじゃないから、\"どこから来たかわからない\"だけでお前を認識できないんだ。」\r\n　「なんで…？けど、私はお前じゃないじゃないか！私は別にいる…」\r\n　「だって俺…とっても愛しいだろ？」\r\n　何度目かの侮蔑を込めた疑問の音。\r\n　「俺ってかわいいだろ？素敵だろう？愛しいだろう？？俺は俺を愛してるんだ。ぐちゃぐちゃにしたいし喜ばせたいし泣かせたい…でもさ、実体や存在がいっこだと、愛すのに制限ができちゃうだろ？そんなの嫌。俺は俺を好きなだけ好きなように愛したいんだ！だからお前を創った！！完全別個の俺自身を…！」\r\n　「そんなのおかしい！……お前変だよ。壊れてる…破綻してるんだ、お前の感情は…」\r\n　セーレンが説明する間も、否定の言葉を並べる今も、クノーテンはセーレンの顔を見なかった。見られなかった。そんなことをしたら、自分までまた壊れてしまうような気がしたから。\r\n　「お前は…お前が壊れてるんだ、セーレン。だからそんなことを言う。そんなはずないだろ？そんなはず…」\r\n　ずっと、同等の扱いを望んでいたはずの少年は、事実という理由でなく、ただ受け入れたくないというだけで片割れを侮辱した。\r\n　「…俺は世界で、お前は俺だから、お前も世界そのものなんだよ。そして俺は俺が好きだから、俺である世界をお前も愛してる。けど俺は俺以外はどうでもいいから、お前は俺のことどうでもいいと感じてしまうんだ。」\r\n　「違う、そうじゃない！」\r\n　セーレンの説明には、おかしな前提がある。そう指摘するとゆっくりとクノーテンは両手を下げた。\r\n　彼の言葉は自分もセーレンなのだと説得するものだ。おかしいのはそこじゃない。それも信じがたいことではあるけれど。未だに夢であればと願うけれど。\r\n　「おかしいよ、お前…なんで、自分を愛してるんだ…」\r\n　多くの生き物は、我が身かわいさに行動を起こす。けれども彼の自己愛は、そういうレベルの愛ではない。\r\n　「………え？」\r\n　「セーレン…お前は変なんだ。自覚した方がいい。お前の言う愛も、その対象も、おかしい…そんな感情は自分に向けるべきじゃない。……そっか、寂しいんだな、お前…そうだよな、お前を必要としてるやつらは、結局は根拠のある力がほしいだけだものな。だから、そんな風に自分を…」\r\n　「黙れ。」\r\n　ぞっとして、思わず少年は少年を見た。それまで恐れていたものはなくなっていたが、別の恐怖がクノーテンを支配する。\r\n　「…そんなのと一緒にするな。俺は俺として俺を認識したときから俺を愛してるんだ。環境も境遇も関係ない。そんなものはいくらでも創れる飾りだ。大人しく認めろよ。お前だって俺なんだから…」\r\n　目もそらせずに固まるクノーテンにセーレンは勢いよく飛び付く。彼が触れると、びくりとクノーテンの肩は揺れた。\r\n　「あっ…あ……」\r\n　愛しくて堪らなかった。今までのような調教からの反射ではない。心のそこから、自分は、彼を…自分を愛している。\r\n　「ねえ？クノーテン…お前は、わかってくれるよね？」\r\n　「ちがっ…こんなの…あぁっ……やっぱり、こわ、れて…る…」\r\n　それども認めるわけにはいかない。これ以上彼に触れてはいけない。言葉を交わしてはいけない。\r\n　頭ではそうわかっているのに、体は全くいうことを聞かなかった。セーレンを求めて、彼と身を重ねていた。\r\n　「俺はお前がいれば何にもいらない。力も、世界も、何も…」\r\n　「むじゅん、してるよ…お前は、世界なんだろ…？」\r\n　「うん。とっても邪魔。そうじゃなければ、クノーテンは俺を拒絶しないのにさ。」\r\n　「それがっ…わからない！」\r\n　一層激しい痙攣を起こしてクノーテンは仰け反った。次の言葉は、混濁する意識をおさめてからであった。\r\n　「お前は、世界そのもので、お前が世界を嫌ってるから、私がお前を嫌いになるのはわかる。…でもどうして、お前は私を嫌わないんだ？そもそも、自分が好きなのに、どうして世界が嫌いなんてことがおこる…？」\r\n　驚いた。彼はすっかり自分を理解しているようだ。今までの我儘な一つ覚えの上部の否定はどうしたのだろう。\r\n　セーレンがそんなことを考えていると、クノーテンが答えられないのかと確認する。\r\n　「…いや、お前があまりにも簡単に受け入れるからちょっとびっくりしただけだよ。…あのね、ひとつめは勘違いだ。俺はしっかりお前のことを嫌っている。お前なんか、自分なんかだいっきらいだよ？世界が嫌いなんだから、当たり前だ。」\r\n　セーレンは真顔のまま、クノーテンを離した手をぶらつかせて立ち上がる。\r\n　「ふたつめも当然なんだ。世界なんて漠然とした言葉だからわかりにくいんだろうけど…世界ってのには全てのものが含まれてる。例えば、アインやスフォリアもそうだ。世界はアインだし、世界はスフォリアなんだ。…けど、アインは世界じゃないし、スフォリアも違う。それが俺との違い。俺以外は一方通行なんだ。…言うなれば他のやつらは皆世界の一部。一部が一部を嫌うこともあれば、愛すこともある。そもそも世界に好きと嫌いという概念がある時点で、俺が俺を好きでいながら嫌いになるのは当たり前のことなんだよ。」\r\n　すらすらと彼は説明する。それまでクノーテンを愛して乱れていた姿からは想像できない、\"いつもの\"セーレンであった。\r\n　「……」\r\n　「…けど、ちょっとばかりお前は俺を嫌いすぎだ。他のやつに認められることばかりを気にしてる。理解できないよ。」\r\n　クノーテンもすっかり冷静になっていた。自分にはわかる。どうして自分が、彼を愛しながらもそれを優先しないのか。\r\n　「…簡単なことだよ。私はお前でありながら、お前じゃないせいだ。」\r\n　「は？」\r\n　そうして爽やかな笑みさえ浮かべてまっすぐに\"彼\"を見つめた。\r\n　「自我ってのはさ…ユニークを望むんだ。だって、私がお前を真っ向から愛してしまったら、私はセーレンと同じになる。…そっか。だからきっと、お前に認められても満たされなかったんだな。」\r\n　セーレンはずっと、自分を\"双子\"としてではなく\"自分\"と認めて接していたのだ。そんな彼から、唯一確かな自分が得られるはずはない。\r\n　どういうことかと彼は不安を額に浮かべて補足を求めていた。\r\n　「…私は、お前でないことを望んでいるんだ。愛する自分を捨ててでも。」\r\n　少年は一層穏やかな笑顔でそう告げた。彼がその意味を理解しないはずはないと高をくくって。\r\n　が。\r\n　鈍い音がして、セーレンはクノーテンを押し倒す。怒りで己をいっぱいにしていた。クノーテンの理解が追い付くのも待たずに彼を捕らえていた。\r\n　「…セー、レン？」\r\n　「………………………」\r\n　次第に、その怒りには困惑も混ざっていることを知った。\r\n　「俺でないことを、望んでいる…？何言ってんの？」\r\n　今までのような空っぽの繰り返しじゃない。彼は全てを解った上で強くそう意思を示している。それが余計にセーレンを混乱させていた。\r\n　「な、何って…だって、そもそもお前は別の存在として私を……？！やめて、強要しないで、私はお前だけど、お前じゃないんだ…！いやだ、私を取るな…っ！？」\r\n　「許さない。許さない許さない許さない許さない許さない許さない！！お前は俺だ！別の存在というだけで、俺イガイのなニモノデもナイ…！！」\r\n　「やめろ！わたし、わぁ、…っ……」\r\n　クノーテンはセーレンの勢いに、強制的な同調に虹彩を震わせ抵抗していたが、彼には勝てるはずもなく、その強引な意思で塗りつぶされる。そうして、やってきたのが…\r\n　「……せ、れん…？ふふ、セーレンだぁ…セーレン、すきだよ、セーレン……」\r\n　その子は、重い愛に押し潰されて自分を失った彼の姿ではなかった。\r\n　その子は、ただ自分がすっかりセーレンであると受け入れてしまったクノーテンであったのだ。`","\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nimport

`　「彼」だけがその場で静かに微笑んでいた。\r\n　風が、それまでの蟠りを、悩みを不安を吹き飛ばすように入ってきては出、彼の髪を揺らしていた。部屋には無数の紙と、小さなガラス細工が転がりその場の異常さを演出する。\r\n　グラナートもシアンもサラテリも、扉を開けた勢いを忘れて、事態も掴めずに唖然とする他なかった。\r\n　ただ、そこには「彼」がいただけであったのだが…\r\n\r\nプロローグ.　ウェルド\r\n\r\n　彼は、どこにでもいる普通の青年であった。\r\n　勉強はあまりできないが運動神経はそこそこ、特にトウ術においてはそれなりの才能を持ち、父と妹との3人暮らし。歳の違う親友がおり、仲の良いクラスメートがおり、人並みな恋心も持ち合わせている。本当にどこにでもいる、「普通の」人物だった。\r\n　終業を知らせる音が鳴り響くと、すぐにそのようなものは欠き消されるほどの喧騒に包まれる。きょうは少しだけ特別だったこともあり、一層辺りは騒がしかった。\r\n　ウェルドは紙の束を整えて鞄へ雑に詰めていく。別段怒っているわけでも急いでいるわけでもなく、単純に彼がそこまで几帳面な性格をしていないからである。そうして帰宅準備を進めていると、前の席の人物が身を乗り出してきた。\r\n　「きょうバハラに行かないか？」\r\n　ヴァイナスとウェルドはスクイルに入ってから妙に馬があってよくつるんでいた。問われて青年は少し考える。きょうは夏の丱のちょうど真ん中。だからベクは禁止されていて、少し早く帰宅できる。彼のように友人と遊ぶもよし、家で孝行するもよし。\r\n　「んー…悪い、やめとく。」\r\n　返事をもらうとそうか、と彼は別の友人を誘いに席を離れていった。周りはこんなにも賑やかなのに、なんだかそんな生活音を永遠聞かされているだけ、取り残されているようだった。\r\n　スクイルと道との境に差し掛かる頃であった。後ろから知性と好奇心の混ざった声がかかる。振り向くと親友のシアンの姿があった。\r\n　「やあ、真っ直ぐ帰るのかい？」\r\n　立ち止まった足を再び元の方向へ戻せば、シアンも隣へ並び歩き出す。\r\n　「まあ、特にすることもないし…」\r\n　予定も計画もない。断ったのはただの気まぐれだ。気分じゃない。その程度の理由だった。\r\n　「じゃあさ、家で遊ぼうよ。…と、その前に買い物頼まれてるんだった。」\r\n　「いいぜ、付き合うさ。」\r\n　彼らはそのまま真っ直ぐ道を辿っていく。ばらばらと周りの生徒達が側を歩いていた。\r\n　ついこの間2の灯があったばかりだというのに、少し早いだけの終業に、何をそんなに浮かれるのだろうか。そんなことを考えていれば、やがて道には樹木が現れる。それらが深くなるより手前で十字路を曲がれば、小店の並ぶところへ出る。スクイルから反対側へ向かえば、それこそハバラバもあるほど栄えた通りに行けるのだが、帰り道の買い物には適していない。\r\n　ふっと目前が白に溢れる。\r\n　「ウェルド？どうかした？」\r\n　気がつけば十字路の真ん中で立ち止まっていた。\r\n　「んいや？…ちょっとぼーっとしてただけだ。で、何が必要なんだよ？」\r\n　「常用品だよ。雑貨屋にいけば揃うと思う。」\r\n　\r\n　雑貨屋の店主はもの好きで、必要な品からそうでない、何に使えるのかさえわからぬ品まで、小さな店に閉じ込めていた。シアンが買うべき品定めをしている間、ウェルドは店の奥へと足を運ぶ。それはセンスもない飾りであったり、蛇足にまみれた道具だったりと様々で、呆れが顔から剥がせない。\r\n　そんな中、ふと目に留まったのは液体をいれる容器であった。所謂カップにしては分厚くてそこも深い。けれども最も異様なことは、その持ち手と思われる場所についている、おそらく2つのカテンであろう装飾であった。上体はよく絵に描かれる二枚羽の人間に近い姿なのだが、下部で2つなのか1つなのかが判別つかなくなる程自然に\"繋がって\"いた。青年はぎくりとして虹彩を震わせたが、しかしどうしたことか顔を背けることができなかった。\r\n　「お待たせ。ほら、行こう。」\r\n　少し離れて聞こえた呼び声で我に返る。\r\n　「…あ、ああ。って、結構な量だな。」\r\n　会計場所まで戻っていけば、両手に大荷物を抱えたシアンがいた。数もそうだが、大きな物が占めているという印象だった。\r\n　「でしょ？だから姉さんには行かせたくなくて。」\r\n　シアンの義姉、ヴェローナの姿を思い浮かべ、なるほどとひとつ頷き、先ほどの感情は全て消え去ってしまった。ウェルドの恋心とはつまりはそういうことなのだが、彼女の方はシアン同様の弟のように感じているのではないだろうか。\r\n　店主がひとつあくびをして、からりと扉の鐘が鳴った。\r\n　\r\n　やる気のない、というよりは当然と馴染みすぎてもはや無意識の挨拶が開閉音の後に聞こえると、食事の支度をしていたグラナートは手を止め、部屋と廊下の敷居から玄関を覗く。そうしてやって来たウェルドを迎え、もう少しでできるからと皿を取り出した。\r\n　「親父、きょうは？」\r\n　「父さんならゴウシだよ。泊まりだって。」\r\n　「ふーん、綸段ってのは相変わらず忙しいな。」\r\n　ウェルドとグラナートの父、カテドラルは仕事で家にいることは少ない。それなのにと珍しくその所在を尋ねた兄に、何か用があったのかとグラナートは後ろで纏めていた二段縛りの下をほどきながら尋ねる。答えは「別に」とその話は終わったかのように素っ気ないものであった。\r\n　食事が終わると、二人は居間で映画を見る。グラナートが借りたものらしい。彼女はこの手の、夢見がちな恋愛劇には興味がないものとばかり思っていたのだが…と気になったウェルドは問いかけた。\r\n　「お前、こういうの好きだっけ？」\r\n　「うーん…好きか嫌いかは難しいな。でも、シエナが好きだからさ。見ておけば話せるでしょう？」\r\n　少女はここらでは珍しい銀の髪をこてりと揺らす。そこに謙虚さはあれど意思なき愛想笑いはない。ただ純に楽しむための努力。グラナートとはそういう人物であった。\r\n　彼女は生徒からも教師からも、どんな人からも好かれていた。聡明で美しく、穏健で、しかし強さを秘めている。惹かれるなという方が無理というもの。兄であるウェルドでさえ嫉妬を通り越して感心してしまうほどである。\r\n　彼は、そんな完璧な妹とは違って、ごく普通の青年であった。`","export const novel = `　そこまで、という威厳のある声が聞こえ、図ったかのように鐘が鳴った。ラスは都市・ゴウシから山一つを隔てたところにある小さな町だ。そのほぼ中央に位置するのがここ、「ホオズキ・スクイル」。ラスで唯一のスクイル。制限が明確にあるわけではないがおよそ２から５段の人が通っている。\r\n　人々はその能力によって１３の段に分けられる。例えば生まれたばかりで自分が何であるかも認識できぬ状態、または生の数を重ねたことで新しいモノが受け入れられなかったり能力が衰えてしまった者は０段とされる。生の数でなく個人の才に依存し、一生の間に必ず１２までなるとは限らず、能力に恵まれていれば例え生の数が小さくとも１２段へ分類されることも理論上可能であった。\r\n　スクイルは段ごとのクラスに分かれ相応しい教育、指導を受けることができ、能力つまりは段数を上げる手段の一つである。\r\n　ウェルドは３段の教室で常勉強をしていた。生の数からも”一般的”な段数ではあるが、彼の場合はトウ道による技能が点数の大半を占めている。彼はあまり賢くないのだ。\r\n　張りつめた空気が一変し、それでも挨拶だけは背筋を伸ばし行って師範を見送ると、後は愚痴やら不満やらで場は溢れかえる。\r\n　一息ついたウェルドへシアンが駆け寄る。彼らは打ち合わせなく同じベクを選んでいた。\r\n　「お疲れ。相変わらずすごいな。」\r\n　「ははっ、唯一の取り柄だからなー。」\r\n　冗談めかして片付けをする親友を見つめて、彼が手合わせしている間に聞こえた悪態をシアンは思い出していた。\r\n　―あいつの親はあのカテドラルさんだもんな。進段の心配なんかないから、術にも集中できるって訳だ。\r\n　ウェルドの養父・カテドラル・アラバスター。彼は段を決定する綸段(りんだん)という職務についていた。無論その大役を担うものとして、特にあの厳しいカテドラルに限ってはそのような依怙贔屓などただの言いがかりではあるのだが、綸段が子を持つのは異例のことで、努力が実らずつまらない者達には格好の理由(えさ)であったのだ。\r\n　彼は気にしていないようなのだが、思うところが無いわけではないだろう。\r\n　「…ウェルドは、ウェルドだからさ。」\r\n　「ん…？何だよいきなり…」\r\n　何でもないと首を振れば、ははと笑ってきっとすぐに忘れてしまうだろう。片付けが一段落すると、やがて錠の閉められるその場を後にして2人は帰路についた。ベクは任意とはいえ、ほとんどの者が選択している。それは才を見つけるためであったり、友を探すためであったり、単に帰るのが嫌だという者もいる。だからこの時間スクイル周りは生徒で溢れる。人混みの合間をぬってようやく一息つけたのは、店の並ぶ道へと続く十字路に差し掛かったところであった。\r\n　突然、ウェルドが立ち止まる。\"この前\"のようにぼーっとしているのだろうと、ここにはシンアキでもあるのかと苦笑いしながらシアンはどうしたのかと問いかける。\r\n　返事はない。\r\n　肩を叩けばこちらを認めるため意識はあるようなのに、感情の全てを失ってしまったかのように\"応え\"が返ってこなかった。\r\n　恐る恐る名を呼ぶ。呼び慣れた音のはずなのに、違和感が拭えない。それを\"そう\"呼ぶべきでないと本能が告げているみたいだった。\r\n　「ど、どうしたんだい、本当に…」\r\n　彼は風でも通りすぎるように踵を返すともとの道を辿っていく。咄嗟にシアンは追いかけたのだが、道は不自然に人で溢れかえってすぐに見失い、身動きすらできなくなっていた。\r\n　信じられないような現実を見つめ直すために強く瞬きした。\r\n　次に見た光景は自分と、帰り道を退屈そうに歩く生徒が一人いるがらりと寂しいいつもの道であった。\r\n　\r\n　彼が向かった先は、ガラスの壁の前だった。その中から派手な衣服が空の光を受けて主張するように存在していたが、彼にとってはどうでも良いことであった。\r\n　ただ、その透明な板に映る自分を見つめていた。\r\n　周りのものがクスクスと笑っている。店の中から不審に見つめる瞳がある。\r\n　ただ、不思議でたまらなかった。\r\n　そんな彼に声をかけたのは通りすがりの不良たち。進段を諦め、かといって働くでなく、ただその瞬間を遊びに耽っている者たち。\r\n　「よお、兄ちゃん。将来の考え事かい？」\r\n　青年が振り向くと側に二人、少し離れてハカンを地につけてさっさとどこかへ行きたいと言わんばかりにあくびをするおそらく彼らの仲間であろう人物が一人いた。無論誰も彼の知り合いではない。\r\n　「幸せだね～。ちょいとオレらにも分けてくんないかなぁ？」\r\n　近くの不良の一人が手のひらを空に向けて二本指だけを青年へと向ける。金を要求するジェスチャーだ。\r\n　しかし彼にそのような知識はなく、じっと続きを待っていた。通じないと分かってもう一人が直球に用件をのべた。\r\n　「あのねぇ、アタシたちにちょっとお金貸してくれれば良いの。余裕あるんでしょ？」\r\n　青年は依然として無言のままであった。\r\n　苛立った一人が胸蔵を掴む、がすぐに高い音が場を貫く。\r\n　「っち、治安維持局か…やっぱまだ早すぎたな。」\r\n　「もう、行こう！こいつ、頑固みたいだし…」\r\n　不良らはもう一人のところへ戻っていくと、音の主が現れるより早くハカンを走らせていってしまった。ぽつりと、青年が「ガンコ…」と呟いた。\r\n　\r\n　挨拶こそ返されたものの、明らかに不機嫌な親友にどうしたものかとシアンは目をそらす。本人は態度に現れてることに気づいていないのか気にしていないのかは定かではないが、今朝は早めに一人で行けば良かったかなと内心後悔する。\r\n　「…なんか嫌なことでもあったのか？」\r\n　「は？何でだよ。」\r\n　どうやら前者らしい。\r\n　それにしてもウェルドがここまで怒っているのは珍しいことだ。誰かに何かを言われても適当に流したり素直に受け入れることの方が多い。それは決して他人の顔色をうかがっているからではなく、最も純粋に気にしていないか納得しているかというだけの話だ。\r\n　「…何でって、めちゃくちゃ怒ってるじゃん。」\r\n　指摘にウェルドは足を止める。キノウのこともあってシアンは少し身構えたが、彼は単に唖然としただけであった。\r\n　「やっぱ気づいてなかったんだ…珍しいね。周りも見えないほど怒ってるなんて。」\r\n　「いや、その…ちょっと、嫌なやつに会っちまって…」\r\n　彼は再び歩き出すと大きくため息をつく。\r\n　「嫌な人？え、だれ？」\r\n　「…その、あれだよあれ、不良！キノウあのあとちょっと用事を思い出して町に行ったんだけどさ、あんな時間なのに不良に絡まれて…」\r\n　うわっとシアンも顔を歪ませる。生の数12にして4段を持つ彼にとってはその類いの行動原理も思考も理解できず、苦手意識を持っていた。\r\n　「え、大丈夫だったの…？」\r\n　「あーなんか、治安維持局が見回りしてたみたいで…」\r\n　具体的なことを起こされる前に慌てて逃げていったらしいと、まるで誰かから聞いたかのように彼は告げ、少年は安堵とともに苦笑いする。実際、\"ヒトゴト\"に限りなく近いのだがそんなことは彼の知るところではない。\r\n　ウェルドのその苛立ちはクラスルームへ入っても、中休みで食事をとってもおさまることはなかった。\r\n　「お前さ、何そんな怒ってんだよ？」\r\n　いい加減気になったヴァイナスは空になった紙袋を丸めながら尋ねる。ウェルドもまた食べ終えた箱を元の通り…とまではいかずとも蓋を閉めて包み纏めた。\r\n　「怒ってねーよ。全っ然気にしてないし。」\r\n　誰がどう見てもそうは思わないだろ…とヴァイナスは目を細めたが、側にいた別の人物が話題を変えて理由は有耶無耶になってしまう。\r\n　彼が怒っていた理由。そのきっかけがなんであるかはウェルド自身も言っていた通り\"あったから\"だと理解していたが、根本の理由は彼にもわからなかった。\r\n　だからこそ、ただの背景としか認識していなかったここへやって来たのだ。\r\n　目前にそびえ立つ清潔で頑丈そうな建物は、やや田舎のこの町に\"そういうもの\"を追いやるかのように冷酷であった。近くにあるものの、一度だって来たことはない。自分はある意味で\"通うべき\"なのであろうが、どうにも恥ずかしく、そんな思いをしてまで対処するほどの事態も今までになく、ついつい先送りにしてしまっていた。\r\n　けれども、今回ばかりは見逃すわけにはいかない。動機がわからずとも原因はわかっている。これ以上事が起こる前にどうにかして消してしまわなければ。\r\n　そう、確かにベクの時決心していたはずなのに。\r\n　彼はため息をついて恐る恐る扉の取っ手に触れてみては指が強ばって引っ込めてしまう。そんなことを数回繰り返して結局入ることができていない。説明をするのも、そもそもここへ来るということ自体が嫌で仕方がなかった。\r\n　そんな風に怪しい人物を演じていると、背後から圧を感じた。随分と強面の人物が入りたいからどけと見下ろしていたのだ。\r\n　さっと身を引いて顔を隠すように頭を下げる。そんな彼には目もくれずにその人物は慣れた足取りで受け付けまで真っ直ぐ向かう。視線だけでその様子を伺ったウェルドは、扉がしまる前になんとか入ることだけはできた。\r\n　棚にはいくつか本が並べられていたが、誰もてにとって読もうとするものはいないようであった。それもそのはず、彼らはみんな\"同じ方\"を向いていたのだ。その異様さに笑いが込み上げてきて、慌てて手で口を隠した。\r\n　待合室は程よい温度と明るさで満たされ、落ち着きのある机と椅子とが並べられていた。隅々まで掃除が行き届いているようだし、退屈しのぎの配慮もされていて、それだけみれば居心地の良いはずなのだが、むしろそれこそがこの施設の目的だと告げられているようで、彼の緊張は解けなかった。らしくないなとまたため息が漏れる。\r\n　がたがたとかわいらしい人形が動き、終業を知らせた。ウェルドははっとして、辺りを見渡す。つい先程まで賑わっていたように思ったのだが、がらんと待合室は寂しかった。何をしているのだと慌てて置いていた鞄を持ち上げ、何も変われぬまま扉を振り返った。\r\n　「帰ってしまうのかい。」\r\n　穏やかな声が人気のない部屋に響く。青年が声の主を振り返ると、髪と同じ茶の髭を綺麗に切り揃えた医院者らしき人物がいた。\r\n　「だって…もうおわりでしょう？」\r\n　「まあ、誰もいなければね。」\r\n　自分は受付もしていないのだからとウェルドは説明したが、困っているようだから、と医者も負けない。ちらと男の背後に不服そうにこちらを見つめる他の医院者か手伝い人がいた。その者は、視線に気づいた医者がウェルドへ少し待っててと告げ、何事かを話すと気分良くしてどこかへ姿を消してしまった。\r\n　「すまないね、で、どうする？話してみるだけでもどうかな。」\r\n　青年は少し考えたが、このまま出直しても同じ事をしてしまいそうだなと甘えてみることにした。\r\n　案内された部屋は診察室というより、モデルルームとか、もっぱら誰かに見せるためみたいな印象を受けて唖然とする。その反応に慣れている医者は逆にリラックスできないかなと冗談を言った。\r\n　すとんと背もたれのない椅子に座る。他にも部屋にはいくつかあったが、特に気にせずに近いものを選んだだけだった。続いて医者も机の側の正面に座った。\r\n　「さて、と…話したいことから話してごらん。」\r\n　男は優しい口調で静かに待つ。羞恥心が邪魔をしてすぐに言えないことに気づいているのかとどこか冷静な自分がいるのに彼は\"勘違い\"して肩を震わせた。\r\n　「じ、つは…俺は、たぶん解離性同一性障害なんです。」\r\n　医者はただ、相づちを打っただけであった。慌てて青年は弁解する。\r\n　「いや、その…正確には、違うと思うんですけど…」\r\n　「…というと？」\r\n　案外真面目に取り扱ってくれるものなのか。それとも、一先ずは主張を聞こうと傍観しているだけなのか…\r\n　無論医者は自己申告で決めつけたわけではない、後者だった。けれどもそうとは分からないように彼を信じてもいた。少なくとも、彼がそう\"認識\"しているのが事実なら、彼の真実ではあるのだから。\r\n　「ほら、よく聞く話じゃ記憶が分かれてるでしょう？けど俺の場合は、別にそういうことはないんです。俺自身が、その時は俺の言動に納得しているのに、\"俺\"に戻ると理解さえできなくなる…あとから記憶だけ渡されてる、みたいな…自分が取り替えられてるみたいな…」\r\n　ウェルドは片腕をもう片方で支えるように握っていた。\r\n　「あいつは…絶対に俺なんかじゃないのに、俺である間は俺以外の何者でもなくて…ああ、もう、なんて説明したらいいんだ、これ…」\r\n　医者は大方の事情は分かったから気にしなくていいと諭すと、具体的にいつからそのように感じているのかと尋ね、口ごもってしまったウェルドへ、話しやすいようにそういえばと話題を少し変えた。\r\n　「君は受付をしていなかったね。私はサラテリ・エルフェンバイン。ここでは…一応院長を勤めている。君の名前は？」\r\n　「あ、ウェルドです。ウェルド・アラバスター…」\r\n　彼にとってはいつものことである名字への質問に、親の名を明かし、場が少しだけ暖まった。\r\n　「まあ、養父ですけどね。…俺も妹も捨て子だったんです。それ以前のことは全然覚えてませんから…そうだったのは少なくとも9つくらいのときからですかね。」\r\n　医者はひらりと机上の紙を一枚取り出し、何事かをスラスラ書いていく。今までの簡単な情報だろう。後できちんと纏めるためかもしれないし、冷静に見つめるためのメモというだけかもしれない。\r\n　「なるほどね…けどまたどうして、キョウは来たんだい？それまで来なかったのは、別に必要が無かったからだろう。それは構わないんだけど…何かあった？」\r\n　ぎくりとして、キノウのことを回想する。まず何から話すべきなのか、とひとつ深呼吸して口を開いた。\r\n　「それが起こるのは…家でひとりか、妹と二人のときだけだったんです。妹もそれは了解していて当たり前のように接してくれるんですけど…きのう\"外\"であいつは出てきた。何のきっかけもなく、やりたいことがあったわけでもないのに…」\r\n　そうは言っているものの、例え理由があっても、彼は\"それ\"が出るのを快く思っていないようであった。医者は手元のメモに兄妹の仲がよさそうなことと、ウェルドが\"その状態\"をひどく嫌っていることを記号として書き加えた。\r\n　「…だから、ここに来れば何とかなるかなと思って……先生、どうしたらあれは消えますか？」\r\n　興奮状態にあるのか先程までの人の良さそうな姿は影を潜め、\"消える\"と言い放たれた音は悲しいほど冷たかった。医者は困ったように微笑むと補足する。\r\n　「焦らなくてもいいよ。別に消すことばかりが\"良い\"訳でもないし…様子を見るって手もあるよ。」\r\n　そんな彼を青年はきっと睨む。サラテリが憎かった訳ではない。どうしても彼には\"消す\"以外の選択肢が見えなかったのだ。\r\n　「そんな悠長なこと…あいつは、『シャ」\r\n　しかし何かを思い出したのか見開いた目をそのままに言葉をきると、彼やや顔を伏せ黙りこんでしまう。言いたいことを丸め込んだというよりも、どこか彼方へ送ってしまったように落ち着いていた。医者がどうかしたのかと尋ねれば、ゆっくりと瞳を向けて薄く笑った。\r\n　その笑みは、冷たい方がましなほど、ただ「無」であった。\r\n　「フフ…医者というのは案外表六なのだな。事実な訳はないだろう…？まさかこのような時間まで本気で相手にするとは…おかげで興も削がれた。」\r\n　突然変化したウェルドの態度にうっかり唖然として口を開けたが、すぐに冷静さを取り戻すと言葉の真意を尋ねた。\r\n　「まだわからないのか？全て俺の虚言だ。まあ…少しはタノシめたかな。」\r\n　そう言って彼は不慣れな手つきで椅子の脚に立てていた鞄を取り寄せると、立ち上がり戸を開ける。\r\n　「…本当に、全て嘘なのかい？」\r\n　「…くどい。」\r\n　彼は振り返りもせずに、来たことがないのにそれを悟られぬようにしているかのような足取りで出口へと向かった。サラテリは何も言わずにそんな彼を見送った。\r\n　\r\n　ドン、と何かが壁にぶつかるような音にグラナートは肩を震わせる。そうして父と顔を見合せ、音の聞こえた天井を見上げた。おそらく発生源は兄の部屋であろう。彼が怒るとすれば、その理由は…\r\n　彼女は父へ自分が見てくることを告げると階段を上っていく。一度だけカテドラルは自分が行くことを提案したが、グラナートが優しく微笑みながら強く否定の意思を示すと静かに頷いた。彼らはただ仲が良いだけではない。いくら養父といえど立ち入れぬ強い繋がりのようなものが、記憶を持たずして存在していた。\r\n　上階の板を踏み、廊下の突き当たりがウェルドの部屋であった。再び大きな音がした。\r\n　グラナートは念のためノックして状態を確かめたが、案の定返事はない。入るなとの忠告もないので、ゆっくりと扉を開けた。\r\n　彼は明かりもつけずに机の前で立っていた。\r\n　「…珍しいね。下にお父さんいるのに。」\r\n　「…ああ。ひどく荒れているようだ。とてもじゃないが、表には出せない。」\r\n　正面を向いたまま、後ろ手で扉を閉める。カテドラルは…グラナート以外の誰もが、彼の\"状態\"を知らなかった。\r\n　「何かあったの？今朝から気分悪そうだったけど…」\r\n　ウェルドは静かに首をふる。しかしそれは何でもないと言い張るような強がりではなく、わからないという意味の動作だった。その意図を汲み取ったグラナートは質問を変えた。\r\n　「なら…いつもと違うこと、何かした？」\r\n　青年はちらと視線だけで妹を見る。\r\n　「別に何も。…俺はただ、『ウェルド』を守るだけだ。」\r\n　そう、と少女は俯いた。おそらくはその気持ちを汲み取れない気遣いこそが要因なのだろう。しかし、そのような説明をしても\"今の\"兄には何も伝わらない。だからこそただぐっと噛み締めて話を変えた。\r\n　「ねえ、次の休み…一緒に買い物に行こう。ちょっと見たいものがあるんだ。」\r\n　「…それは、\"俺\"に言っているのか？」\r\n　勿論、とグラナートは頷く。\r\n　「兄さんが世間知らずなのは外に出ないからだよ。家でしか、それも私の前でしか出てこないんだもの。それじゃ、いつまでたっても何もわからないままだと思うな。」\r\n　「別に構やしないだろ…あんなやつ、どこ行ったって何を経験したって同じさ。変わりっこない。人の気持ちも、いや、自分の気持ちだって理解してないんだからな。」\r\n　「兄さん…」\r\n　ウェルドは乱暴にベッドに寝転ぶと、もう寝るから出ていってくれと呟いた。グラナートは寂しそうに目を細めて、戸を開け、敷居を跨いだところで顔だけ振り返る。\r\n　「…買い物、付き合ってくれる？」\r\n　「ああ、俺がなんでもやってやるさ。だからもう、あいつには頼むな。…お前にも、迷惑をかけちまう。」\r\n　そんなことはない、と溢れそうになった涙をこらえて少女は部屋を後にした。再び廊下の明かりも絶たれて、外の光も布で遮られた部屋には闇が訪れた。\r\n　ウェルドは「彼」が嫌いだった。\r\n　グラナートはどうしても「彼」が嫌いになれなかった。\r\n　\r\n　よくもまあ、意味不明な言葉を調べて、考えて利用しようと試みるものだな、と例文の書き連ねられた冊子を見下して意味もなくペンを走らせる。言葉など、意思が通じればそれでいい。それをわざわざ、フロスが使っていただの知らないが、昔のものを引っ張り出して一般教養などとすり替えるのはやめてほしいものだ。\r\n　食事休憩を終えた始めの科目は、ウェルドの大の苦手な―とはいえ彼には苦手な物の方が多いのだが―クロワンであった。\r\n　確かにフロスは凄いと思うし、それなりに敬意を持ってはいるが、むしろだからこそ、彼らの言葉を弄くり回すのはどうかと思う。所詮人間には理解できぬ事柄ではないのだろうか…などと様々最もらしい理由をつけて、本当は単に理解が追い付かないだけの難問から逃げて、こうして紙面に落書きしていた。やがて時間となって、その紙が課題になったことを知ると、またため息をつく。\r\n　「お前なぁ、さすがにジョウクくらいは訳せるようになれよ。それでも3段かよ。」\r\n　「悪かったなぁ、俺はどーせトウ術しかできねぇよ！」\r\n　ヴァイナスが振り向いてからかうのに開き直ってウェルドは応える。それはいつもの事で、すぐに次の科目の話なり全く関係のない話なりに進んでいくのだが、キョウはどうしたことか友人は真剣な表情をした。\r\n　「いや、真面目にそろそろやばいだろ。ロワを判別もできないんじゃ、この先進段の希望はないぞ？それどころか、もしかしたらその年で降段なんてことも…？」\r\n　やめろやめろと慌てたウェルドに、ヴァイナスは笑顔を取り戻す。通常、段が下がるのは能力の発達が終わったハンキシからである。それ以前では大きな怪我をして物理的に無理だとか、重罪を犯しただとか、よっぽどのことがなければまずあり得なかった。\r\n　「…仕方ないだろ。なんか、ロワって見るだけで気分悪くなるんだよな…」\r\n　それは単に面倒くさがってるからだろう、とヴァイナスは心で呟く。やがて休憩の時間が終わり、もう2科目を終え、ベクの準備となる。\r\n　トウ道の支度を進めながら、ウェルドはシアンに心配事を漏らした。\r\n　「やっぱ、ジョウクくらいできなきゃまずいかなー…」\r\n　急に何を言い出すのだと笑うシアンに、課題がだされたものの、手始めのジョウクを書き記すとこからできる気がしないと弱気に告げた。\r\n　「え…ジョウクできないって本当だったの？！僕はてっきり、大袈裟に言っていたのだと…」\r\n　お前まで馬鹿にするか、と怒ったように見せたものの、急に並んでいるのも恥ずかしくなって彼は少し距離を開けた。そんなことは気づかずにシアンは感想を続ける。\r\n　「ほんとに君はすごいなぁ…よくそれで、3段を貰えたものだ…」\r\n　「なっ…コネとかじゃねえぞ？俺はわざわざ3段の試験はドーパースまで行って受けたんだからな？！」\r\n　誰が見ても、4段ですら低いと思われるほどのグラナートはともかく、ウェルドには親に甘えて、コネだろうとの噂がついてまわり、そう言われるのが嫌で3段を狙っていたときの試験は毎回、2つ離れた港まで受けに行っていた。無論シアンもそのことは知っている。彼の才は極端に偏っているなと複雑な気持ちになったものだ。\r\n　「でもほら、きっと苦手意識が邪魔してるだけだよ。それさえ拭えれば何とでもなるって。」\r\n　それからシアンはそもそもトウ道は反射神経や筋力頼りでは限度があって…などと説明をはじめて、ウェルドは相変わらず御託を並べる、と目をそらした。\r\n　帰り道、それなら自分の家で勉強会でもするかとのシアンの提案に、一瞬だけ明るい顔をしたものの、彼の部屋で課題をするということは、つまり彼女にも自分がその程度のやつだと晒すわけで…との欲望が邪魔をして、用事があるからと断った。事実、やらなければならないことが無いわけでもない。キノウの無礼を、せめて詫びにいかなければ。\r\n　再び立ちふさがった建物に息をのむ。とはいえ、キノウよりは「謝りたい」という理由のあるせいかいくらか入るのに苦労がかからなかった。受付で用件を述べ、マニュアル口調な係から順番を知らされ、ぼーっと椅子に座る。やがて名が呼ばれて通された先に、医者が微笑んでいた。\r\n　ウェルドは部屋へ入るや否や、勢いよく頭を下げる。\r\n　「…すみませんでした！」\r\n　その様子に医者と案内した手伝い人が目を丸くする。が、すぐにサラテリは気にしなくていいと、椅子へ座るよう、手伝い人へは受付へ戻るよう指示を出す。それから再び青年に向き直って理由を聞いた。\r\n　「…失礼なことを、言ってしまって。先生はあんな時間まで話を聞いてくれたのに、俺は…」\r\n　「けれどそれは、君のせいじゃないだろう。」\r\n　「いや、俺のせいです。本当は、全部覚えてる。そのとき何を考えていて、何故そんなことをするのか…ただ、そんなものは\"自分\"じゃないって、すり替えたいだけなんだ…」\r\n　そういえばキノウも、\"記憶を所持している\"…そのような説明をしていたなと医者は髭を撫でた。とはいえ、だ。それが真としても言うなれば「有」に戻った彼の表情とあのときの「無」そのものが気分程度で切り替わるようなものなのかはいささか疑問ではある。\r\n　「何か共通点とか…君がそうなるトリガーはありそうかい。」\r\n　先へ進んだ医者の話に青年は短い驚きの声をあげる。今までそうなった瞬間―一つずつ、覚えている範囲を回想してみたが、これといってきっかけは無いように思う。そもそも、妹以外の誰もいないところである、という共通点が破られたために、こうして焦って医院へと足を運んだのだ。\r\n　「さあ…キノウもどうして、突然そう思ったのか…とにかく、こんなところにいるべきじゃないと。ここにいたら、不安が増すばかりだから、先生がこれ以上関わらないような言い訳を、と。…けど別に、俺は\"不安\"なんて感じて無いんです。先生は話を聞いてくれたし…騙して楽しむなんてことも…」\r\n　「ああ、わかっているよ。君は他人に迷惑をかけるのを好むような薄情者じゃない。ここへ来たのだって、その状況を何とかしようとしたからだろう。」\r\n　医者は勘違いを心配する必要がないことを述べると、キノウよりもしっかりとした紙を慣れた手つきで取り出した。\r\n　―さて、どうするべきか。\r\n　彼の望む治療は、彼が自分を見失わないこと。確かにただの気分屋ならば、それがいいのだろう。けれども、彼が自己分析しているように、所謂\"DID\"と呼ばれるそれではないにせよ、\"気が変わった\"にしてはあまりにも違いすぎる、別の存在とも思えてしまう状態なのだ。\r\n　「そのままって訳にもいかないだろうけど、とりあえず、焦らずゆっくりと対処していくようにしよう。一番いけないのはその状態が訪れることではなくて、その状態を恐れて気が弱ってしまうことだからね。」\r\n　「…はあ…」\r\n　それは承知を含まない了解のような返事であった。おそらく彼はとても素直なのだろう。完全に納得していないことを包み隠すことはしなかった。\r\n　\r\n　家につくと思い出したように憂鬱がやってくる。けれどもそれは医院に行くべきものではなく、これから古語(ロワ)と向き合わなければならないという、なんとも平凡な悩みだ。自室に籠って取り組む気にもなれなくて、カップへ飲み物を注いで居間の机を使うことにした。\r\n　「ええと…………これは……」\r\n　得体の知れぬ記号が時々切れて並んでいる。無意識に紙に線をのせていったら、このようなものはすぐにできあがるのではと思うほど、彼の目にはでたらめにうつる。\r\n　「ああ、もう、やっぱり文字じゃないだろ、これ…」\r\n　見つめているだけで、自分の存在を見失いそうな吐き気に襲われる。すぐにでも破り捨てて、なんなら焼くなり食うなり跡形もなくしてしまいたい。\r\n　「ロワ？」\r\n　透き通った声に顔をあげる。いつの間にやら帰宅したグラナートが覗いていた。ウェルドは頷くと課題であると説明した。\r\n　「解読か…ふふ、なんだか懐かしいな。」\r\n　4段ともなると、そもそも真意が解明されていないために一定以上の解読は困難となり、今度は軽い記述が主になると聞く。見るだけでも嫌なものを書かなければならないなど、それだけで進段など諦めたいくらいだった。\r\n　「お前らよくわかるよなぁ…」\r\n　「…というか、兄さんが嫌悪しすぎなんだと思う。」\r\n　課題として義務を課せられると嫌がるものは少なくはなかったが、ウェルドのように\"ロワ\"そのものを忌み嫌う者は稀であった。加えて、彼にはその\"明確な理由\"がない。トラウマだとかの嫌な思い出があるわけではないのだ。\r\n　グラナートは飲み物を用意すると隣へと腰かける。\r\n　「あーあ、どうせならやってくれれば良いのに…」\r\n　独り言のように愚痴をもらすと、さすがにバレてしまうだろうし、その場かぎりの他人頼りの回避策では今後のためにならないから無意味にしてしまうだろうと妹に諭され、そうではないと首を振る。\r\n　「お前じゃなくて、俺がだよ。不必要なときには現れて余計なことしてくのに、こういう、誰かに代わってほしいときは何の役にもたたないんだものな。」\r\n　「そんなこといっても…彼もできないんじゃない？」\r\n　ウェルドは観念したのかやけになったのかスラスラと適当にペンを動かした。\r\n　「わーってるって。別に正解を期待しちゃいないさ。けど、どうせ俺がやったって変わんないなら、こんな気分でいるよりましさ。」\r\n　そういうものではないだろうと、端から諦めている青年の手元を黙って見つめながら思う。何かの丸暗記か創作か、その文章のジョウクとはかけ離れた文が連なっていた。\r\n　\r\n　結局、その課題を終えることができたのは随分と遅い時間―むしろ朝早くであった。はじめこそ枠を埋めれば良いかと進んでいたペンだが、急に罪悪感のようなものがわいて、もう少し真面目に取り組もうとした結果である。おかげで軽い寝不足。\r\n　初手の授業からおおきなあくびをしてしまい、教師に気付かれ、これを解いてみろと紙を差し出され、答えを誘導する文句が書かれた。\r\n　ウェルドは一瞬だけしまったと顔を歪ませたが、すぐに真剣な表情となるとまっすぐ前へと進む。そうして教師の手の紙をちらとだけ見て、彼の文字の続きへとペンを持った手を向ける。\r\n　一呼吸の後に、彼は止まることを忘れたような勢いで記述を開始した。今は現実と関係のない値をこねくりまわす科目であったが、彼は今朝までやっていた\"ロワ\"を部屋に掲げられたボードへびっしりと詰めていった。誰もが呆気にとられ、ボードの端へとたどり着くと同時に響いた休憩開始音も聞こえぬのかしばらくは動かなかった。\r\n　はじめに動いたのは教師であった。彼は目を丸めたままゆっくりと、ただやるべきこと―片付けをして部屋を出ていった。\r\n　面白がったのかそれは休憩時間中消されることはなく、むしろ生徒が集まって議論を交わす題となっていた。ウェルドもまた、絶望の表情で机に突っ伏していた。\r\n　「なんだよお前、クロワンできんじゃねーか。」\r\n　ヴァイナス他数名が机の周囲へ集まっていた。彼らもまた、ウェルドがクロワンを苦手だと認識していたのだが、ジョウクさえ解らぬ彼の記述した文章でその認識は間違っていたと思い直していた。\r\n　「なあなあ、あそこはどうやって訳すんだ？」\r\n　「あれはきっと情景だろ。」\r\n　「そうかな…だって次には結論だろ？…まあ、ジョウクに意味なんかないけど…」\r\n　そんな彼らの反応さえ、青年には苦痛であった。気づいたヴァイナスが体調を尋ねたが、静かに首を振るだけで会話さえしたくないようであった。\r\n　勿論ウェルドも、自分がそれを書いたことは知っている。怒っていたわけでも眠気でテンションが上がっていた訳でもない。ただ真面目に、その問いの答えを創り上げただけだった。そのためにロワを使ったのだ。\r\n　けれどもどうしてその結論に至ったのかがまるでわからない。今考えると、ギョウタンとクロワンなど結び付かぬほど違う分野だし、ロワはただの言葉。それも現代では使わない、もっとふわふわとした概念の不要な言葉なのだ。何を思えば答えの記述に使うと考えるのだろう。\r\n　始業の合図が聞こえると、再びひどい眠気に襲われる。寝不足も原因であろうが、ここ最近の憂鬱が逃避を促進させているのかもしれない。彼はかくりと落とした顔を持ち上げ、目の前の教本に目を通す。コングリバット―医院に関係する学問であった。何をするでなくとも、ただ座っているだけで黙々と授業は進んでいく。前方で偉そうに歩き回る人間の話は半分も理解できないが、周りをみてもあまり真剣に取り組む姿は見えない。そんなものかと説明音を聞き入れるに留めた。\r\n　「あれ、キョウは弁当じゃないのか？いつも妹のすっげーの持ってくるのに。」\r\n　クラスメートのからかいに、彼は特に反応を示さなかった。ただ無意味に窓の外を見つめる。まだ拗ねてるようだと彼らは呆れて購買へと向かっていった。\r\n　「どうした？食べないの？」\r\n　あらかじめ食事を買ってきていたセイランは開けた袋から先を取り出し一口食べ、ウェルドに話しかけた。彼は体勢も視線も変えずに「忘れた。」と呟いたが、鞄の側に置かれた包みがあるのにその言い訳は適当すぎるだろうと苦笑いされる。\r\n　「…俺は食べない。」\r\n　「もしかして、具合悪い？それとも朝のあれ？気にしなくていいよ、むしろ凄いことでしょ？…まあ、ちょっと挑発的ではあったかもだけどさ…」\r\n　彼は、青年が順当に答えなかったことを、常識がないと判断されないかを心配しているものと思ってそう気遣った。\r\n　進段に影響する能力というのは、何も知識や技能だけではない。生活力だとか倫理観だとか、常識力と呼ばれるようなものもしっかりと見られ、スクイルは良いものも悪いものも情報として提供する。\r\n　やがて買い物へ行った友人らも戻ってきたが、ウェルドは依然として態度を変えなかった。\r\n\r\n\r\n　起きた後の穏やかな時間帯に、何やらせっせと階段から降りてきてまっすぐに一生懸命靴を履き出す兄を、グラナートは不思議そうに見つめていた。\r\n　「兄さん、まだお弁当できてないけど…」\r\n　彼女の手には長めの箸が握られている。まだ出校には早すぎるというのに、ウェルドは側に鞄をおいて紐を結んでいたのだ。\r\n　「…必要ない。」\r\n　「けど…『ウェルド』のときに困るよ。」\r\n　言葉の雰囲気から察すると、彼女は\"彼\"との会話を始める。ぎゅっと歪に結ばれた紐が揺れてウェルドは立ち上がり、彼女を振り向く。\r\n　「ガッコウへも行かない。」\r\n　「どうしたの？急に…」\r\n　「あそこは”不安”になる。だからキライだ。」\r\n　言い終わるまで顔を伏せて、ぱっと鞄を手に取ると、扉の取っ手を掴む。引き寄せるように力を入れようとしたところで、糸が張られるような声が通る。\r\n　「何のつもりだ、ウェルド。」\r\n　カテドラルであった。先ほどまでリビングで紙面に目を通していた彼だったが、会話が聞こえたのだろう、不穏なウェルドを確かめに来ていつの間にか兄妹の後ろに控えていた。\r\n　彼ははじめこそ無反応だったが、突然びくりと肩を震わせると、恐る恐る振り向く。\r\n　「え……ああ、いや、ちょっと走ってくるっ」\r\n　そうして冷や汗のついた笑顔で鞄をそばの棚に放るように置くと、一目散に駆けていった。取り残されたようにカテドラルとグラナートは顔を見合わせるも、すぐに元の位置へ戻っていった。\r\n\r\n　弁当の箱を机に並べ、そこへ料理を盛っていく。キノウの残りと、すぐにできるものを詰め終わると、今度はボウルにトルを割った。\r\n　「…やつのことだが。」\r\n　カテドラルは読んでいた本を閉じると、調理をするグラナートに問いかける。\r\n　「何かを隠しているのか？」\r\n　「え……」\r\n　カテドラルは\"動揺していた\"ことからそう推測したのだが「それ」を知るグラナートは内心焦る。\r\n　「……どうだろう。」\r\n　父は、もうひとりのウェルドを知らなかった。\r\n　「ウェルド」がそれを望まなかったし、\"彼\"も他人と話すのは好まなかった。彼女もそれを知っていたから、むやみやたらと誰かに教えたりはしない。\r\n　「知らぬならよい。」\r\n　グラナートはトルに火が通るのに待ちくたびれて、箸でつついた。`","export

`　誤解させて貶めるつもりだ。\r\n　震えた声でそう告げた青年を少女が優しく宥めていた。キョウは話に聞いていた妹、グラナートも帰りの時刻が同じだったからとやって来ていた。彼が来るのは不定期で、スクイルでその症状が現れてからいくつか夜が過ぎた後であるらしい。無論その事について責める気も言及するつもりも医者にはない。やや行動原理が不定なために疑問はあるが。\r\n　「…なるほどね。言うならば\"彼\"は積極的になったと。」\r\n　これまで―9つから14までその存在をウェルドとグラナートが認識こそすれ、その他の人の前で話すことはおろか、出ようとさえしなかったのに、だ。\r\n　「もしかして…この前兄さんが、代わって欲しいって言ったから…？」\r\n　「そんなことを言ったのかい？」\r\n　「え…言ったっけ？」\r\n　グラナートは以前彼がロワの課題に愚痴をこぼしていたことを思い出す。けれども当のウェルドは、冗談という、できるはずがないという認識からかすっかり忘れているようであった。\r\n　「…っつっても、冗談だろ？関係ないと思うけどな。」\r\n　「彼、冗談とか分からなさそうだし…」\r\n　そんなものなのかと医者は傍観する。あったのは一度きりな上、警戒されていたのかまともに会話をしてもらえなかったために、\"彼\"の人となりについては口を挟めない。\r\n　「しかしそれが本当だとすると…その子は別に、君を貶めるつもりはないんじゃないのかな。」\r\n　どういうことだと口を曲げたウェルドに、仮に彼女の主張―\"代わりに行おうとした\"ことと\"常識的な区別も、他への気遣いも下手\"というものが正しかったとする。ならばウェルドの代わりにスクイルで受け答えたことも「代役を務めるには役不足であった」と考えれば意図的ではないといえるのではないか。とサラテリは説明した。\r\n　グラナートも補足する。\r\n　「彼はよく、兄さん…『ウェルド』は自分が守るべきだと言っています。私も、別に悪気はないと思いますが…」\r\n　妹をちらと横目に見てため息をつく。違う。奴の意図はそんなところにはない。けれどもきちんとした説明もできそうもなくて、それ以上の感情だけのような反論は抑え込んだ。\r\n　「まあ、何にしても無理はしないようにね。若いから徹夜も多少は平気かもしれないけど、寝不足は良くないから。」\r\n　頑張ります、とウェルドは苦笑いする。グラナートが自分も注意すると意気込むと、げっと顔を歪ませた。微笑ましい関係だ。彼の話通り、彼ら兄妹には何か強い絆があるらしい。\r\n　彼らはそれでは、と席から立ち上がる。が\r\n　「…表向きのシンパイはやめろ。お前の望みはそこにはない。」\r\n　「…え？」\r\n　彼女の透明な声がやけに響いた。\r\n　強弱を失った瞳は医者を見据えている。サラテリはその色に背筋が凍る思いをしたが、悟られないように強がりな笑みを浮かべた。\r\n　「…そうだね、けど、全く心配してない訳でもないんだけどな。」\r\n　そんな態度に少女は無意識に兄へ寄って不審に、しかし逃さぬかのようにまっすぐ見つめた。\r\n　「君は本当に不思議だ。他人の心を理解していないようで、隠し事は見破れるんだね。…そう、私は君たちの記憶に興味がある。『ウェルド』君は君の状態でも事を覚えてるようだけど、君は完全に『ウェルド』君という訳ではないんだろう…？」\r\n　医者が単に彼を学術的にも興味を持っているだけと知ると、ほっと息を吐いてグラナートは会話を見守った。\r\n　「…俺にもそれくらいの\"判断\"はつく。…別に、俺がどうあろうがお前たちには関係がない。」\r\n　「ふむ…彼の不安はそのせいで大きくなっているとしても…？」\r\n　「……そうなのか？」\r\n　青年はグラナートを振り返る。\r\n　なるほど彼女の言うとおりの性格をしているのかもしれない。本人は至って真面目に取り組んで対応しているのだろうが、繊細な理解がないのだろう。\r\n　「さあ…私よりも先生の方が詳しいだろうから…」\r\n　「その可能性もあるというだけだよ。」\r\n　青年は悩んでいるような素振りをみせ、考えておこう、と呟く。と、ぱっと表情が晴れて帰りに買い物でもしていくかと少女に笑顔を向けた。\r\n　―まるで、今立ち上がったばかりのように。\r\n　そんなことが可能なのだろうか？\r\n　一例を示したに過ぎないのに、即座に彼は記憶を扱ってみせた。それも自分自身であり、他人の記憶を。\r\n　医者は一度思考をやめて、また何かあればと手を振った。\r\n　\r\n　彼らはとても仲がいい。\r\n　それは承知している。長い付き合いなのだ。\r\n　けれども今回は何かが気にかかって、気がついたら静かに後を追っていた。街の方へ向かったことも原因かもしれない。休みでも、早帰りの真ん中でもないというのに。\r\n　シアンはもう一度、そばの椅子へ腰掛けながらその施設を見上げる。彼らの向かった先―そこには医院があったのだ。\r\n　医療館ならば、気がつかなかったとしてもトウ道をしている彼なのだ、世話になることもあるだろう。けれどもここは、彼の陽気さからは一番縁遠いと思われる医所だ。\r\n　やがて玄関の扉からいつも通り楽しそうに会話する兄妹が見えた。はっとしてシアンは立ち上がると、問い詰めるべく門側へ立ちはだかる。\r\n　「シアン君…？」\r\n　「悪いとは思ったよ。プライベートなことだし。…けど、ここへ向かう君たちの表情がどうしても気になって……。何かあったの？」\r\n　ウェルドは笑みを消して親友を見つめる。とはいえ、その表情は無を装ってはいたが、迷いが濃かった。\r\n　口を開いたのはグラナートだった。\r\n　「…ちょっとね、兄さんの寝不足がひどかったから薬でももらおうと…けど、大したことなかったから安心して。」\r\n　「え…？あ、そ、そう…」\r\n　直感的に嘘だろうと彼は思う。あの表情とその説明は合致しない気がしたのだ。そう…あれは、何かを恐れているような顔だった。無論、彼が恐ろしいと感じるものなど、親くらいしか思い付かずに心証にすぎないのだが。\r\n　ウェルドはなにも言わずにそんな困惑したままのシアンの横を通り過ぎていった。すんでのところでやや身をかわした耳元で、いつか話すからと悲しそうな音がした。彼も振り向かなかった。\r\n　グラナートがそんな彼らを心配そうに見つめて、思い出したように兄の後を追っていった。\r\n　ぽつりと取り残されたシアンは行き場のない不安を空へと投げる。\r\n　\r\n　\r\n　科目の境の他より少し長い中休み、珍しくウェルドはいつもつるんでいる輪を抜けて、弁当を食べるでも購買へいくでもなく、風の強い屋上へと足を運んでいた。…どうしようもない\"感情\"を持て余していた。\r\n　いつまでも弾けない泡が天に登って、けれども疲れてふわふわと降りてくる…そんな行き場のない想いのようだった。\r\n　そのような状態だったから、柵の向こうを上の空で見つめる彼が軋むような扉の音に気づいたのも、音の原因の人物が何度か呼び掛けてからであった。\r\n　「どうしたんだ？君がそんな顔するなんて…」\r\n　「…ん、シアンか。いや、ちょっとな…」\r\n　シアンは両肩を少しあげると、そこらに腰かけて持っていた食事の包みを開けた。\r\n　「キョウは購買で買ったのか？」\r\n　「義姉さんが忙しいみたいで。」\r\n　「あー…たしか、キノウからクアリスっつってたっけ。」\r\n　シアンの義理の姉―続柄としては従姉弟が正しいのだが―は菓子作りがうまく、それを見込まれここらではちょっと名の知れた店で働いていた。\r\n　「うん。行ったら？今回は衣装も変えるって言ってたし。」\r\n　「んぐっ……な、別に関係ねーし…」\r\n　そんな友のいつも通りの照れ隠しの反応に吹き出すように笑みが漏れる。改めて、再びどこか遠くを覗き始めた青年を見る。風に揺れる髪質も、瞳の色も部位の形も、グラナートとは似ても似つかないな、と食べ終わった包み紙を丸めながら意味もなく考える。血の繋がりのないカテドラルはともかく、実の妹と称している彼女と、こうまで似ないことはあるのだろうか。\r\n　「腹、減らないのか？」\r\n　「うーん、今は気分じゃない。」\r\n　「あはは、ほんとにベク後に向かう気だったりして。」\r\n　「あのなぁ…」\r\n　シアンとウェルドは一瞬間を開けて笑い合う。いつも通り。きっとこれからもそんな調子なのだろうと、疑うことさえせずに。\r\n　\r\n　シアンの言った通りにするのはなんだか悔しいが、ベクが終わってから空腹が彼を襲った。弟に茶化される前に…とはいえ、シアンは虹祭で出し物をするらしく、ベクが終われば会うこともないのだが、そそくさと街の方へと出掛けていく\r\n　同じようなスクイル生徒やら、働き終った者やらで通りはそれなりに賑わっていた。からりとベルが来客を知らせる。中からパタパタと変わった服の店員が出てきたが、入ってきたウェルドに気づくとシアンと同じような笑みを浮かべて厨房へ接客を手伝ってほしいと声をかけ、自分は荷をもって奥へと入ってしまった。\r\n　「お待たせしました。って、ウェルド君。いらっしゃいな。」\r\n　「や、やあヴェローナ…結構忙しいみたいだな。」\r\n　「ええ。私もたまにこっちへ出なくちゃならないくらい…けど、今はちょっと空きなのに…どうしたのかしら。」\r\n　彼女は要らぬ気遣いに気づいていないようで、不思議そうに先程までの店員が消えていった方を見つめた。\r\n　「あ、…まあ、片付けとかしたかったんじゃねーの？…ったく、どいつもこいつも」\r\n　ウェルドとて、その想いが一方的なものであることは知っていた。周りは面白がってあれこれ手を回すのだが、毎度そのことを思い知らされるような彼女の反応を受けると、ありがた迷惑とはこの事だなとため息が漏れる。\r\n　「どれにする？おすすめはね…」\r\n　彼女のほっそりとした指がショーウィンドウの上を伝っていき、菓子の上で止まると小さく響く綺麗な声が続く。\r\n　「…なんだけど…ウェルド君、ベクで疲れてるんじゃない？」\r\n　「……え？あ、はは…」\r\n　ついついその穏やかな音に浸ってしまって、その意味を微塵も理解できなかった。けれども丁寧に説明してくれたであろう彼女にそんなことは言えぬとおすすめのものを家族分注文した。\r\n　彼の心が落ち着いていたのは受け取った包みを机へと置くまでであった。一緒に安寧まで失ったように心が荒れる。訳もわからず自室まで駆け上がって、持ったままの鞄を壁に叩きつけ、整頓したばかりの教本やら道具やらをぶちまける。\r\n　「…どうした？そんなに荒れるなど……うるさい。」\r\n　からからと散らばった物が余波に音をたて滑っていく。そのなかに1つ、きらりと窓からの光に反射して銀が主張した。ウェルドの瞳がそれを捉えると次の瞬間には彼の手のひらの上へとおさまっていた。驚いたのは\"彼\"だ。\r\n　「やめろ。」\r\n　振り上げた腕を力が抜けたように下ろす。\r\n　「うるさい…邪魔をするな。そんなことをしても、どうにもなりはしない。わかってる！…わかってる、…」\r\n　膝をおり前方へと倒れたが、寝床が彼の体を支えた。\r\n　「……… ……… ………？」\r\n　なにかがおかしい。当然と化していた非常が、再び非常になったようだ。彼はそのまま、静かに意識を手放した。\r\n　\r\n　1つ目の科目が始まる前に、彼は教師に呼び出されていた。しかも相手は最も苦手とするクロワンの担当者。いい加減せめてジョウクはできるようにと叩き込まれるのだろうとぐるぐると目を回していた。\r\n　やがて教師が入ってくる、が予想に反して彼は明るく、むしろ興奮しているようだった。\r\n　「やあ、朝早くからすまないね…ちょっと他は空いてなくて。それより聞いたよ。君本当はロワを書くことだってできるんだろう！？」\r\n　勢いに押し負けてウェルドの反応は遅れた。\r\n　そうする間に教師はバサバサと持っていた筒を広げる。どうやら黒板の画のようだ。\r\n　「ほら、この間のウスガキ先生の授業のときに君が書き出したものだよ。いやあ、もう感心するばかりだね。どうしていままでできないフリをしていたんだい？この古語、もしかしたら10段以上でも書けるかどうか…特にこれ、ケンゴだよね？それに………」\r\n　教師は彼が不快に俯いてしまったことも気にせずにぺらぺらと魅力と興味を語りつくし、我に返ったのもはじめの科目を知らせる音がスクイル内に響き渡ったためであった。\r\n　「…と、しまった、つい。じゃあ、またぜひ話を聞かせてくれ！」\r\n　風のように教師は出ていく。暫くしてもウェルドは動かなかった。ただ、虹彩を震わせ、顔をあげることもできなかった。\r\n　「…遅れるぞ。」\r\n　自分の声にはっとしてようやくばたばたと教室へ戻る。遅刻を注意されたら先程の教師に説明してもらおうと表面で考えてみた。\r\n　休憩後、3段の生徒たちは汎用館へと集まっていた。5人一組で競い合う種目をするのだと告げられ、今はその準備中である。ルールは簡単であったがやたら準備が面倒くさいなと誰もが感じていた。背の高い棒を床のくぼみにはめ、周りにパーティションをおいて間にはロープやら網やらを渡す。一人一人に配られる布が倉庫から出されると仕分けが始まった。\r\n　緩まないよう頑丈に網を括り付けると、ヴァイナスが側で手こそ動かしているものの、あまり力が入っていなさそうなウェルドを気遣う。\r\n　「おいおい、そんなんじゃすぐとれちまうぜ？…なんか顔色悪いぞ。大丈夫か？」\r\n　「……え？あ、ああ。いや、ちょっと夜更かししちまって…」\r\n　「この前も体調崩してたろ…ほどほどにな。」\r\n　はは、と笑顔こそ作ったものの、あまり現実味は無さそうに目が泳いでいた。\r\n　「あー、めんどくせえ。これセットとかでないのかよ？」\r\n　ヴァイナスとは反対隣で作業をしていた生徒が顔をひょっこりと覗かせて愚痴をはく。そういう売りもあるらしいぞとヴァイナスが答えると、進段へ情熱をそそぐ、彼らに言わせれば優等生気取りの少女が注意をした。\r\n　「なんだよ、いい顔しやがって。そんなの見せかけだって見え見えなんだよー、なあ、ウェルド。……ウェルド？」\r\n　呼びかけに青年は笑顔で向き直る。悪態をついた彼の眉間に皺がよったのは何も不思議なことではない。彼は不自然なほど無邪気に笑っていた。\r\n　もしかして何かいい仕返しでも思い付いたのでは、と自分を落ち着かせてもう一度名を呼ぼうとした。時であった。\r\n　ウェルドは片手で彼の顔を遠慮なく掴むと疑問の音も聞かぬ間にもう片方で思いきり殴った。くしゃくしゃになった顔が体を引っ張って飛んでいく。訳がわからなかったのは側で見ていたヴァイナスもだ。\r\n　「……っふふ、く……楽しい…」\r\n　ぞっと、背に何かが伝った。叩きつけられた時の音で驚いて駆け寄った教師の声が響く。館中がざわめくが、まだその原因をわかっているものはそう多くなかった。\r\n　「せ、先生後ろ！」\r\n　被害者の生徒の容態を確認していた教師が、次の標的になった。ヴァイナスの注意も空しくウェルドは地を蹴って一気に距離を詰めると、その勢いのまま教師を踏みつけ、くるりと綺麗に回転した。呆気にとられて静まり返った空間に笑い声が響いた。\r\n　ようやく犯人を知った生徒の一部が各々に行動し始める。恐る恐る出入り口へ向かうもの、どういうつもりだと問い詰めようと近づくもの…しかし何を言われようと、当の本人は無邪気ににこりと笑っていた。それが逆に薄気味悪くて言葉が引っ込んでしまう。\r\n　と。\r\n　いつの間にかその場には残像だけがあった。何かを踏みつけたような音に視線を向ければ生徒の何人かが床に飲み込まれていた。\r\n　「逃げんなよ。楽しみ減っちゃうじゃねーか。」\r\n　相変わらず、そんな風に人を潰しておいて尚彼はにこにことしていた。心の底から楽しんでいるように。それからパニックが起きるまでそうはかからなかった。腰を抜かして外へと走って、そこらの棒を拾って…\r\n　青年は騒音にやや顔を歪ませたが、支柱を引き抜くと一回転して生徒を巻き込み、投げとばし、また生徒が巻き込まれる。どれだけ距離があっても即座に詰められ薙ぎ倒された。\r\n　「おい、ウェルド…！？一体どうしちまったんだよ…」\r\n　「やめとけ、正気じゃない！」\r\n　目を丸くするヴァイナスの腕を別の友人が引いた。見つかれば後はないとはいえ、相手は一人。他の者へ構っている隙を見計らって数人が逃げていった。\r\n　遅れてウェルドはちらと出入り口を見たが、まあいいかと乗っていた胴体をぽんと蹴飛ばした。\r\n　「うぉおお！」\r\n　威勢のいい大柄の男が獲物と共に殴りかかるも、ふわりと浮いた彼を捉えられずに勢いごと突っ伏した。\r\n　とんと静かな足音が響くと、少し遅れて小さな声がした。\r\n　「………え？」\r\n　ウェルドは辺りを見回す。数人の生徒が意識を失って、手には大きな物体が握られている。加えて館に溢れる敵意と恐怖に困惑が隠せない。\r\n　「……ウェルド？」\r\n　「…？なんだこれ…おい、大丈夫か。」\r\n　え、と今度は周りの生徒が唖然と口を開けた。彼は手荷物を音があまりたたないように置いて、しかし急いで自分で倒した者たちへ駆け寄った。怪我の状態を確認し、心配しているようにしか見えなかった。\r\n　ヴァイナスが安堵の息をひとつ吐いて歩み寄っていった。\r\n　「大丈夫か？お前、相当疲れて…」\r\n　が、振り返った青年に蹴飛ばされ、信じがたいほど呆気なく、反対側の壁まで吹っ飛んでいった。ウェルドはまた笑っていた。皆あれは演技だったのだと決めつけて身構える。立っているのはもう半数もいなかった。\r\n　\r\n　何やら事件があったようで、室内が、スクイル全体が騒がしかった。少し前に科目担当も様子を見に出掛けてしまって、ますます収集のつかない状態だ。\r\n　シエナは席を立つと親友のグラナートの元まで歩いていった。\r\n　「何があったんだろうね。…って、どうかした？」\r\n　微かに彼女が震えていたような気がした。けれどもグラナートはすぐに笑顔をつくってその銀糸の髪をさらりと揺らすと当たり障りのない返答をした。\r\n　「グラナートさん、事件があったの3段みたいだ…」\r\n　彼女らへシアンが報告しに来る。顔は蒼白で、焦っているようだ。シエナが落ち着けと諭したがあまり態度は変わらなかった。\r\n　「…本当なの？シアン君。」\r\n　「うん。スケジュールも確認したけど間違いない。しかも、聞いた話じゃ結構な怪我人が出てるって…」\r\n　「へえ、物騒ねぇ。」\r\n　シエナはグラナートやシアンとは仲が良かったが、その身内にまで言及したことはなかった。まして自分より下段のことなど興味もない。とはいえ彼女が特別冷たいわけではなく、それが普通の反応だった。他の騒いでいる者たちも、非常事態に興奮しているに過ぎない。\r\n　「って、二人ともどこ行くの！？」\r\n　「ごめんシエナ。兄さんが心配なの。先生来たら言っておいて。」\r\n　「行こう。」\r\n　連れだって部屋を飛び出していった二人に少し嫉妬するくらい、他人事であるのだ。\r\n　\r\n　やけに人の声がすると思ったら、治安維持局まで駆り出されていたようだ。表に標識を携えた乗り物がちらほら見受けられる。医療館の所有物もある。\r\n　シアンは運び出された怪我人を見渡していたが、グラナートに腕を引かれた。彼女は一心にある方向を見つめていた。\r\n　「ウェルド！」\r\n　「兄さん…！」\r\n　駆け寄った二人と意識のない青年の間に治安維持者が立ちはだかった。\r\n　「おい、君たち近づいては駄目だ！」\r\n　彼はコーリカマスに包まれ、額からは血を流している様子で、二人がそのような言葉で引き下がれるはずはなかった。\r\n　「すみません、兄なんです。怪我はそんなに酷いんですか…」\r\n　「怪我…？ああいや、これは返り血だよ。」\r\n　「返り血…？」\r\n　シアンはもう一度覗き込む。言われてみれば、確かに量の割に傷口は見えなかった。\r\n　「ほら、戻りなさい。…ご兄妹のかたは後で連絡が行くと思うから。」\r\n　諭すように柔らかな声で告げるとすぐに出せ、と仕事へ戻っていった。\r\n　しばらく呆気にとらわれていた少年らは、我に返ると会話もできずに教室へ戻っていった。\r\n　\r\n　気がつけば冷たい灰色が視界に広がっていた。おかしな体勢で眠っていたのかあちこちが軋むように痛い。そこではっと、手足に深錠が施されていることを知った。ウェルドは一度落ち着いて再度部屋を見渡す。どこかで見たと思うのは、おそらく劇中の取り詰めシーンであろう。\r\n　そこは治安維持局の保持する個室のようであった。\r\n　とにかくこんな仕打ちを受けるべき理由が見当たらない。そもそも、汎用館で授業準備をしていたはずなのだ。それから…\r\n　ゆっくりと記憶をたどってみる。そういえば、と何かに行き着きそうなところで扉の音に欠き消されてしまった。治安維持者が二人入ってきたのだ。\r\n　「ああ、気がついたようだね。」\r\n　彼らのうちどちらかというと若そうな青年が声をかけ、持っていた資料を開く。もう一人は慣れた動作でウェルドの向かいの席に座り、間の台を指でこつこつと叩いた。\r\n　「こんにちは。私は治安維持局スオウ係のタイシャ。で、こちらがマスハナ係長だ。君は、ウェルド・アラバスター君で間違いないかな。」\r\n　「ええ…そうですけど。」\r\n　立ったままの青年が対応した。\r\n　「ホオズキ・スクイル3段の生徒。」\r\n　「あの、それがどうかしたんですか。」\r\n　ウェルドにとって治安維持者にあれこれ質問されるのは慣れていないことであった。気づいて青年はただの確認だよと苦笑いする。\r\n　「じゃあ本題に入ろう。どうしてあんなことをしたのかな。」\r\n　待ってましたと正面の者が座り直した。ウェルドは首をかしげ、あんなこと？と繰り返す。\r\n　「スクイルの汎用館で暴れたことだよ。怪我人はクラスメートの過半数、意識不明者も少なくはない。」\r\n　「……え…？」\r\n　身に覚えがない。けれども青年の言葉の内容を、その惨事を想像して、ようやく先ほど記憶の中から見つけ損ねた光景を思い出す。あ、と漏れた声に勢いづいて正面の治維者が音がたつように台を叩いた。\r\n　「さあ、隠さず吐きな。今更無実だなんて通用しないからな。」\r\n　「ま、まってくださいよ…確かにそういう状況は見たけど、俺はなにも…」\r\n　わざとらしいため息の後に、マスハナは続ける。\r\n　「あのなあ、あんな大勢の前で事を起こしといて自分じゃありません、なんて納得されるわけないだろ。」\r\n　「まあまあ、係長…何か事情があって話したくないのかもしれませんし…ねえ君。秘密は守るから、どうか事情を説明してくれないか。」\r\n　圧倒されてウェルドは頷いたものの、自分の方が説明のほしい状況であった。\r\n　「ええと…競技の準備をしていて…」\r\n　歯切れ悪く、気がついたらクラスメートの幾らかが床に伏せっていたことを語るが、ごまかしとしか思えない言葉の少なさにタイシャも苦笑いを浮かべた。\r\n　「そんな顔されたって、俺の方が何がなんだか…いつの間にか捕まっているし、……」\r\n　拘束されて気持ち悪そうに動かしていた腕がぴたりと止まる。目を伏せて黙りこんでしまった青年に、二人はどうしたものかと顔を見合わせた。\r\n　騒ぎの中でなんとか逃げ出した生徒が、教師らへそして治安維持局へ事情はすべて話していた。彼らも直接聞いてはいないものの、資料から動機以外の事の顛末を知っているのだった。知らないと主張するのは当事者だけ。ガワだけでも反省をみせることのない態度に3段でこの程度なのかと少し呆れる。\r\n　「…まさか、シャトルーズが…？いや、でも…」\r\n　「『シャトルーズ』…？誰だ、そりゃあ。」\r\n　「調べてみます。」\r\n　タイシャがぱらぱらと持っていた資料を広げる間、マスハナはウェルドに問いただすが、彼は何でもないの一点張りでそれ以上を話そうとはしなかった。\r\n　「…とりあえずクラスメート、いえ、スクイル関係者にはいなさそうですね。」\r\n　「おい、そいつに指図されたのか？」\r\n　「……」\r\n　「ったく、黙りかよ…」\r\n　と。\r\n　ノックの後に扉が開き、別の治安維持者が入ってきた。彼は失礼します、と一礼してタイシャへ耳打ちする。\r\n　「どうした？」\r\n　「あ、はい実は…」\r\n　次いで部下から事を聞いたマスハナは一層顔が険しくなり、どかりと握りこぶしを台へとぶつけた。ちらとその様子を伺ったウェルドの瞳が不気味に光る。\r\n　「ったく、またその手の奴か。」\r\n　乱暴にいい放つとくるりと座ったままウェルドに側面を向ける形となる。座っていたものは回るのかと少し驚いた。\r\n　「…ああ、精神異常ってだけで罪に問われなくなるなんて。全く、なんて世の中だ。そもそも、異常者でもない奴が事なんか起こすかよ。」\r\n　「ちょっと係長、本人の前ですよ。」\r\n　宥める青年を気にした風もなかったのは、マスハナだけではなかった。言われたウェルドもまた、興味もなさそうに正面の会話を見つめていた。\r\n　「ええと、ウェルド君…」\r\n　「ふふ、違うよ。」\r\n　え…とタイシャの小さな声が響く。\r\n　「やったのはシャトルーズじゃない。オレさ。…手柄とられてたまっかよ…」\r\n　彼はくらりと頭を傾ける。何かに酔いしれるようにふらふらと危ない動きであった。その異常さに唖然とするタイシャの横でマスハナが応対した。\r\n　「ふん、ようやく認めたか。聞いても無駄かも知れないが、なんでやったんだ？」\r\n　「あはは、やりたかったからに決まってんだろ、おっさん。…けど、ちょっと違うんだよなぁ。」\r\n　「はっ…知らぬ存ぜぬの次は狂気アピールか？」\r\n　「本当だって。結果違っただけで、やりたかったはずなんだよな…」\r\n　お互いに興味の無さそうな会話をタイシャは交互に見つめる。彼とて、自分ができることはもうないことはわかっていた。今頃担当医に連絡が行き、後はそちらの係が先を決める。せいぜい、それまで彼をこの場へ引き留めておくくらいが関の山だ。\r\n　「人に危害を加えたかった…てか？なんてこった。」\r\n　「キガイ…？違う、そんなことまで考えてはいないだろう。」\r\n　「じゃあ何がやりたかったって言うんだ！？」\r\n　大声に慌ててタイシャが心配を込めた注意をしたが、相変わらず彼らに聞く耳を持たれずに行き場のない怒りを目を閉じて押し殺す。ウェルドは目を逸らしたり強気に説明したりと忙しく動いていた。\r\n　「……それは、……だから、とにかく潰したりしたかったんだよ！…そうすれば、ふふ、でも、少しは喜んで…」\r\n　その後も彼は自惚れのようにぶつぶつと続けたが、これ以上聞いてはこちらが参ってしまうとマスハナも音を流すことに努めた。\r\n　やがて沈黙に包まれた個室に、ノックの後に医院者を名乗る声が響いた。入ってきたものは立ち位置を確認するように見渡し、治維者へ身分を証す。2人は敬意を示すごとく肩へ手を当てると、どうにかしてくれと言わんばかりにちらと彼を見た。\r\n　「調子はどうだい？」\r\n　医者は近づいて膝を折り、下から青年を見つめる形をとる。見据えるような瞳の光から、それが彼なのだとわかっていた。\r\n　「……あまり良くはないな。少し混乱しているようだ。」\r\n　「一体何があったのか、君はどこまで知っているのかな。」\r\n　「俺は全て知っている。」\r\n　そんな二人の会話を何気なく聞きながら治維者らは各々書類をまとめたりやるせなさにため息をついていた。\r\n　「何かをしたのは、君？それとも…」\r\n　「\"ウェルド\"は何も知らない。……俺は、無駄なことはしない。」\r\n　そのまま受け流そうとしてタイシャははてと椅子で拘束されている青年を見つめ直す。彼は確かに今、自分の名を呼んだ。まるで他人事のように。\r\n　「あの、その子は情緒不安定なんですか？」\r\n　我慢ならずにタイシャが尋ねる。医者は開いた口からの続きを音にせず、一呼吸おいて質問にそのようなものだと頷いたが、ウェルドの方が首を振った。\r\n　「話してくれて構わない。……それで、『ウェルド』の誤解が解けるのならば。」\r\n　「そうかい…？この子は、俗にいう多重人格者なんです。だから、今こうして話している子も正確にはウェルド君ではない。」\r\n　医者は確認のため一度だけウェルドを振り向き、再び治維者へと体を向けた。\r\n　「ああ、あんたにも名乗ってなかったな。俺は『シャトルーズ』……」\r\n　がたりと椅子が傾き直り音をたてた。マスハナが立ち上がったのだ。タイシャも目を丸める。\r\n　「君が……シャトルーズ君！？じゃあ、今回の騒動を仕組んだのは……」\r\n　解決の糸口に詰め寄る維持者達に、しかし青年は冷静に首を振る。\r\n　「俺は何もしていない。『ウェルド』が勘違いをしただけだ。……間にもう一人いただろう？」\r\n　一瞬何のことやらと頭を回し、そういえば会話の途中に自分がやったのだと告白していた者がいたことを思い出す。そのときはただ観念して白状しただけと思っていたのだが。\r\n　「……別の子がいたのかい？それとも、新しく…」\r\n　「『あいつ』にやや負担がかかったらしい。まさかもう一人作ってしまうとはな。」\r\n　医者は頷くと、物珍しそうに立ち尽くす二人へ拘束を解くように提案する。\r\n　「お聞きのように暴れたのは『シャトルーズ』君ではない。どうか深錠を外してやってもらえませんか。やっていないことを責められるのは、誰でも辛い。」\r\n　例え、おおよそ彼からそのような弱音が見えなかったとしても。しかし、ウェルドはまた否定を示す。\r\n　「別に構わない。再度暴れることを懸念するのは仕方のないことだ。今は『ウェルド』も出さない。」\r\n　「……とりあえず、立ち上がれるまでは。私の医院へ連れていきますので。」\r\n　「え、けど先生のところには普通の患者さんもいますよね？こちらにもその施設はあります。」\r\n　タイシャは窓を指し示す。遠くに白い石造りの建物が見えた。\r\n　「……『ウェルド』君も『シャトルーズ』君も普通の子です。彼らは何もしていない。維持局の施設では苦です。」\r\n　ウェルドは問答する二人を交互に見る。彼には判断しかねる事柄で図るような表情だった。\r\n　やがて決着がついて医者が彼のもとへ来ることになった旨を伝える。あまり理解していないような表情のまま、ウェルドは成されるがまま立ち上がり医者の後へ着いて扉を出ていった。\r\n　しまりきる前にまたため息が聞こえた。\r\n　\r\n　まだ眩い日差しの下、知らぬ道をただ歩いた。あまり慣れていないことで、あちこち見回しながらもどれにも興味を持てないようだった。\r\n　やがてかつて出たことのある建物にたどり着く。が、医者は門を越えると人気のない右手へとまっすぐ進んでいくのに、さすがの彼でも不審を示した。\r\n　「どうかしたのかい？」\r\n　サラテリは振り返る。\r\n　「…こちらに人の気配はない。『ウェルド』をどうするつもりだ。」\r\n　彼はいつもより少しだけ怒りの調子を瞳に交えていたが、何かに驚くように瞳を開くと片手を顔に当てる\r\n　「っ……やめろ。…！？お前は休んでいろ。」\r\n　「……すまない、さすがに他の患者と同じ場所は難しくてね。少し寂しいかもしれないが…。」\r\n　そんな彼には構わず医者は説明する。ウェルドも正面へ向き直ると作り笑いで頷いた。\r\n　「構いませんよ俺は。当然ですし……」\r\n　「ウェルド君、出てきて大丈夫なのかい。」\r\n　「あいつに任せるよりましです…それより、何があったんですか？なんでここに…」\r\n　相変わらず\"ウェルド\"は\"シャトルーズ\"を快く思っていないようであった。合点のいかない状況に不快を隠せぬように怒りは続いているようだ。サラテリもどこまで説明したものかと、とりあえずは部屋へ案内することを勧める。\r\n　向かった先は本館へ繋がる廊下のある小さめの棟であった。あまり使われていないのか外へ直接出入りする扉の他、階段から廊下への戸へもいくつか錠がしてある。それらを開けては閉じながら進む医者に案内される道を深くも考えずに進んでいく。\r\n　そうして階段から棟の対角にあたる突き当たりの部屋へと通された。道中覗いた部屋はどこも空で、変わらないとも思ったが、何らかの理由があるのかもしれないし、ならばどこが良いかと聞かれても困るので特に何も言わないことにした。\r\n　「おお…」\r\n　部屋はひとりでいるには幾らか広く、思わず感嘆の声が漏れる。扉から正面にすぐベッドが備え付けられ、越えて重なった椅子が、やや左に壁に張り付く細長めの机とセットで椅子や棚が寄せられている。出入口左手すぐには洗い場が仕切られているようであった。もしかしたらウェルドの部屋よりも一般的に快適と言えるかもしれない。\r\n　「本当にこんなところに…？だって、俺は……」\r\n　「君は何もしていないだろう。それに、大変なのはこれからだからね。」\r\n　部屋の窓には、その理由を告げるようにガラスはあれど取っ手はなかった。入院患者の多いとき、または少し難のある場合に使われる部屋なのであろう、がらんとした廊下が久方ぶりの来客に胸踊っていた。\r\n　「とりあえず、ここまでの経緯だったね。どこままでのことを覚えているんだい…？」\r\n　ウェルドは少しだけ考える素振りを見せてから、\r\n　「ええと…汎用館で準備をしていたところまでは、普通に覚えてます。…けど、気がついたらクラスの奴らが怪我してて…次は治安維持局に捕まってて、目的を聞かれて何が何やら……」\r\n　頭を抱える青年を医者は冷静に見つめる。彼に\"そのこと\"を伝えるべきだろうか…？「ウェルド」は自分を快く思っていない。更に増えたことが、彼にとってどれだけの負荷になるものかと。\r\n　「あれは、……シャトルーズが何かしたんですか？」\r\n　サラテリは即座に否定する。\r\n　「いいや。そうではないことは確かだよ。あの子は君が思っている以上に真面目な子だ。そこは信用していい。」\r\n　「じゃあ、俺が…？覚えてないだけ……だって、あの時手に支柱を持ってた。…そこに、滲んだ何かがついてたのを、今では思い出せるんです。」\r\n　当時は混乱でそこまで気が回らなかった、ということだろう。彼は自らの手のひらを見つめて歯軋りした。\r\n　「……いいや、それも違う。君が覚えていないように、\"君\"自身が何かした訳ではない。」\r\n　「なら、どうして…！！友達に、あんな目で見られなきゃ…っ……」\r\n　めまいでも起こしたのか、くらりと揺れたのを見て医者は身体を支え、ベッドへ座らせるように施す。\r\n　「色々ありすぎた。わからなくて不安なのは最もだが、あれこれ一気に知るのも苦痛だと思うよ。もう少し落ち着いてからにしよう…」\r\n　無言のままこくりと頷いたのを確認して医者は館内出歩きの説明をする。手の奥に隠された、不敵な笑みにも気づかずに。\r\n　「気分転換に外へ出たい気持ちもわかるが、治安維持局との約束で、この部屋以外に行くときは私や、誰かここの医者を訪ねてくれ。そこにボタンがあるだろう？ファッジュへと繋がっているから、いつでも対応するよ。」\r\n　彼はそれだけ言うと、別の予定があるのかそれじゃあ、と扉を閉めて出ていった。錠前の余韻も消え、残された部屋に、くっく、というような不気味な音が響く。\r\n　「…『ウェルド』じゃないのに。簡単にやり過ごせるもんなんだな。」\r\n　彼はぱっと立ち上がって一つ伸びをする。\r\n　―さて、もう一度試してみなくては。\r\n　そうして窓を振り返り、口角を上げた。\r\n　\r\n　シラアイは\"キョク\"という精神病の患者だった。発作が起きる度嘘の記憶が作られ、現実とのギャップにパニックを起こす。とはいえ、今では治療のかいあって回復へ向かっている。もう半灯は発作も起きていない。退院も近いだろうと本人も思っていた。\r\n　「では、また何かあったら呼んでくださいね。」\r\n　習慣の散歩兼現状確認を終え、担当医が笑顔を作って部屋から出ていくと、単純な身体的疲労からベッドへ腰掛けひとつ息を吐く。生の数が多いせいか近頃はすぐに疲れてしまうのだ。\r\n　私ももうだめかなと自虐的な考えを独り言として呟き、何気なしに天井を見上げる。\r\n　見慣れぬ\"何か\"がそこにはいた。ダクトに足を引っ掻け逆さにぶらさがっている。人の形を成してはいるが、出入りも含めとても人業には思えずただ唖然と口を開け見つめる他なかった。\r\n　彼女が自分に気づいたことを知ると、それはにこりと無邪気に笑って、ぴょんと飛び降り腰に両手を当て上体をやや傾けた。\r\n　始めこそ不気味に思ったものの、その嬉しそうな顔につられて彼女もまた、口の端が上がろうとするところであった。しかし笑顔を見るより早く、それは彼女の背後に身を移し、その丸くなり始めた背を思いきり蹴り飛ばした。\r\n　「あっれぇ、もうのびちまうのか？」\r\n　予想していなかったように不思議そうにぐったりと動かなくなった老女の顔を覗く。ぽんぽんと腰の辺りを叩いたり、猫だまししてみたり、反応を待ったが、一向に動く気配が見られずに腕を組んだ。が、すぐに名案でも浮かんだように、鍵のかかったままの窓からひょいと出ていった。\r\n　そのまま器用に壁の窪みを利用して伝っていき、今度は斜め下の部屋へ入っていく。突然の来客にその部屋の主は驚き、しかし今度は複数人いたため悲鳴をあげる者、医者を呼ぶ者がいた。\r\n　とはいえ今の彼に煩いなとは感じても、そんなことを気にする思考があるわけもなく、地を蹴ると一人の頭に逆立ちし、向こう側へ飛び越えて置いてあったランプを引きちぎるように手元へ収め、目の前の人物へ投げつける。動揺していた患者に―たとえそうでなくとも―避けることはできない。\r\n　「うらぁ！」\r\n　続けて近くの人物を遠ざけるように拳を見舞い、物が頭部に直撃し、気を失ったというのに構わず殴り飛ばした人物の所有物であろう分厚い本をいくつか抱えると重さを知らぬかのようにいとも容易く掲げて投げつけた。\r\n　他の者は逃げることも戦うこともできずにただ助けを待ちながら惨事を見届けていた。\r\n　ウェルドは抱えた物を一通り投げ終わるとひょこひょこと気絶している者のところへ歩いていく。\r\n　「ねえ、シんだ？ねえ？」\r\n　そこでようやく医者が扉を開けた。\r\n　「どうし…何があったんだ…！？」\r\n　駆けつけた医者の二人は訳がわからないながらも、パニックで震える患者を宥めて回り、応援を呼ぶとおそらく問題を起こしたであろう立っている人物へ慎重に近づく。\r\n　「君は…たしか。しかし、なぜ……」\r\n　立ちすくむ青年の前を医者は警戒しながら通りすぎ、怪我を負った患者を外へと運び出す。予想に反し彼は動かなかった。\r\n　「どうしました？！」\r\n　やがて応援としてまた複数人が駆けつけた。近くにいたのかそこにはサラテリの姿もある。\r\n　「ウェルド君？！どうしてここに…」\r\n　彼は患者を他の医者に任せるとそっとウェルドに寄り、顔を覗いた。が、瞳の光を確認するより早くウェルドが崩れ落ちる。\r\n　「………」\r\n　「…部屋に戻ろうか。」\r\n　サラテリは彼を支えると、驚く患者たちから隠すように連れ出していった。`","export

`　部屋へと連れ戻した医者の手が肩から外れても、彼は顔をあげなかった。ベッドへ深く座り込んだまま、何も言わずに頭を覆っている。\r\n　医者も無駄口は叩かずに、ただ彼が落ち着くのを待った。しばらくして、青年が呟く。\r\n　「……もう一人、いるんですね？」\r\n　漏れそうになった声を飲み込み、サラテリは静かに頷いた。\r\n　「\"あいつ\"にあんなことのできるはずがない。それに、うまく覚えてもいない。…俺は、こんなこと、望んでなんか……」\r\n　「勿論だとも。気に病む必要はない。君が悪い訳じゃないのだから。」\r\n　「へえ、じゃあおれが悪いっての？」\r\n　声音が一変すると今度は試すような笑みを見せる。医者は驚きも見せずにただ質問した。\r\n　「……君にも、何らかの動機がありそうだね。無差別だけど、無意味ではなさそうだ。」\r\n　「はは、あんた変な奴だな。」\r\n　彼は手に重心を乗せて後ろに傾く。ほんの少しだけ、弾むように足を動かしていた。\r\n　「……はじめまして、になるのかな。私はサラテリ。君は？」\r\n　「名前がほしーなら、テキトーに呼べば？どうせ区別できれば良いんだろ。」\r\n　遠回しがいけないのかと直接聞いてもこの反応だ。どうしたものかと医者が頭を悩ませていると、閉じているだけの扉が勢いよく開いた。\r\n　「ウェルド！」\r\n　「兄さん、大丈夫…？」\r\n　駆け入ってきたのはシアンとグラナートだった。スクイルが終わる頃は過ぎていたものの、常の彼らが帰るのにはまだ幾らか早い。おそらくは義務以外はキャンセルして飛んできたのだろう。\r\n　「グラナート、シアン……？」\r\n　彼の声にも優しさが戻っていた。\r\n　やや遅れて医院者が一人入ってきて、サラテリに止めたのだがと言い訳する。そのことは特に咎めず、少し距離をおいて彼らを見守った。\r\n　「事件に巻き込まれたってきいて、けど、良かった……」\r\n　「悪い、心配かけて。俺は大丈夫だから。」\r\n　感極まって抱きつく妹の頭を青年は申し訳なさそうに優しく撫でる。シアンもほっとしたのか涙を浮かべて心配したのだと怒っていた。\r\n　「兄さん、一体何があったの…？」\r\n　しかし落ち着いて息を整えたグラナートの問いに、彼の顔から宥めるような笑顔は消えた。勘の良い彼女は、すぐにそれに関するのだと気づいて無関係のシアンをちらと見た。\r\n　「……いや、シアンにはもう隠してられないな。……なあ、多重人格ってわかるか。」\r\n　「え？……うん、まあ。話に聞いたことくらいは。けどどうしてそんなことを……まさか。」\r\n　「そうさ。俺はそれに似たようなもんだ。たぶんお前らが想像してるのとはちょっと違うんだが……」\r\n　シアンはその説明に、それ以前の暴露にしばらく目を白黒させていたが、今はその状態の真偽を確かめる必要はないと先の質問をした。\r\n　「じゃあ、事件ってのも君じゃない君…が関係するのか？」\r\n　グラナートがきっとシアンを睨む。何かまずかったのかと少年がびくりとしたのに気づいてウェルドは妹へ向き直った。\r\n　「いや、\"あいつ\"じゃないんだ…もう一人、できちまったみたいで…」\r\n　冗談にしたいのか彼は苦し紛れな笑みを作る。特に、彼が嫌いなことを知るグラナートには、ウェルドの気持ちが直に伝わってくるようで、どうしようもない感情を地へ送る。話についていけないシアンが更なる説明を求めた。\r\n　「……ええと、随分前からそうだったの？それに、今回の事は…」\r\n　「シアン…君と言ったかな。」\r\n　が、今まで成り行きを見るだけだった医者が、意気込む姿勢にぴくりと反応した青年を見逃さずに口を出した。いつの間にかもう一人の医院者は部屋を後にしていた。\r\n　「…悪いが、ウェルド君は疲れているようだ。大方の経緯や事情なら私でも説明できる。部屋を移そう。…妹さんはどうする？」\r\n　少女は感心した表情のまま、少し話したいと頷く。医者も彼らの仲は知っている。おそらくはさほど負担にならない―むしろ、落ち着く手助けになるかもしれないと笑顔を戻す。\r\n　シアンはやや不服そうに、しかし心配なのは同じなのだろう、友に無理はするなよと告げて医者と共に部屋を出ていった。\r\n　足音が聞こえなくなるとグラナートはひとつため息をついた。\r\n　「……どうした？」\r\n　「ううん。ちょっと安心しただけ。兄さんは大丈夫？」\r\n　「俺は問題ない。」\r\n　少女が静かに寝床へと腰かけ直すと、習ってウェルドも姿勢を正した。彼女は前方の、何もない扉を無意味に見つめ続ける。\r\n　「……グラナート。」\r\n　「何？」\r\n　「…悪い。色々ありすぎた。これからもどうなるかわからない。」\r\n　「兄さんが謝ることじゃないよ。それより、本当に無事で良かった。はじめは怪我したんじゃないかって、とてもしんぱい、したんだから……っ」\r\n　彼女にしては珍しく感情から言葉を詰まらせた。ウェルドは妹を大切にしていたが、グラナートもまた、兄を何よりも想っている。ただ人前を気にして冷静さを保っていただけだったのだ―\r\n　\r\n　「じゃあ、僕と出会ったときは既にそうだったんですね……。」\r\n　少年が悔しそうに目を細めたのに医者は誤解を解くべく補足する。\r\n　「ウェルド君はもう一人の彼…シャトルーズ君を良く思っていないようでね。誰かに話す以前にその話をする事自体避けていたようだから。」\r\n　「あ、ごめんなさい。そういうんじゃないんです。…今思えば、あの時から様子が変だったのに…僕は、こんなことになるまで気づきもしないで。」\r\n　シアンは邪魔なものを吐き捨てるように息を思い切り出すと、よし、と前を向く。\r\n　「できるだけ、やれることをしようと思います。…そりゃ、義姉さんやグラナートさん程元気付けられないとは思うけれど…」\r\n　「いや、友人の存在は嬉しいものだよ。是非、これからも会ってあげてほしい。」\r\n　シアンは瞳に強くて危うい光を灯し続けたまま頷いた。\r\n　\r\n　サラテリは目を閉じ、溜め息を深呼吸に擬態させて自身を一度落ち着かせた。そうして開いた視界の先には顔を両手で覆って項垂れる青年の姿が、周りの負の視線にさらされていた。彼は他の医院者や手伝い人に被害者の他目撃者らへも注意を彼からそらすよう対応してほしいと指示を出すと、ゆっくりウェルドの元へと歩いていく。差し出された手に、それでも彼は首を振ると一人静かに立ち上がる。\r\n　「部屋へ戻ろう。」\r\n　決められた物の並ぶ殺風景な部屋に帰っても、彼は座りもせずにただじっと窓の向こう側を望んでいた。硝子戸に映る無表情にサラテリは不安を覚えながらも、事務的に質問を続ける。\r\n　「落ち着けたかい。」\r\n　「………………」\r\n　ウェルドは悩んでいた。自分の感情がうまくわからないのだ。口ではそんなはずはないと言っているものの、その実\"自分\"は何を感じ、何を想うのかがはっきりしない。今まで当たり前だった\"おもしろいこと\"。それは、本当にそうだったのだろうか。本当に、悲しいことだったのだろうか…？\r\n　「ま、少しは…ってとこかな。まだまだ足りねぇけど。」\r\n　反射する表情がへらりと笑う。深刻さはどこへやら、彼は振り返ると挑発するように重心を移して腰に手をあてる。\r\n　「君は、」と言葉を続けようとした医者だが、すぐに\"戻った\"不安を見ると続きは飲み込んだ。彼は目があったことへ動揺して顔を背けるが、考えても答えはでないことを悟ったのかようやく口を開いた。とはいえ、出てきたのはその場しのぎの文句だったのだが。\r\n　無理はしないようにと決まり事を告げ、青年の言葉どおりに医者は部屋を後にする。腹のうちでは面倒な奴と思われているのだろうなどと下らない考えだけがはっきりとしていた。\r\n　「……\"シャトルーズ\"。\r\n　…なんだ。」\r\n　記憶を共有する彼にとって、己と会話することに昔から難はなかった。自分が何を言ったかを思い出せばいい。けれど。\r\n　「どうして、新しい奴のときの記憶はないんだ？\r\n　…………」\r\n　口は動かない。考えも変わらない。\r\n　彼にもわからないということなのだろうか。それとも。\r\n　「もしかしてお前は、俺の記憶を操…\r\n　フフ…俺がそのようなことのできるはずもない。単に《あれ》はそこまでお前ではないというだけだろう。」\r\n　まるで打ち切るような、彼にしてはやや強引なやり方にウェルドは機嫌を損ねる。が、すぐにどっと疲れが押し寄せて窓際の机に肘を押し付けた。\r\n　「……大丈夫か。\r\n　これくらい、なんとも……」\r\n　ひどく眠いような気だるさ、これがようやく落ち着いて思い出しただけならばいいのだが…。意識を保つのがやっとであった。\r\n　「しばらく休め。その間は…\r\n　お前が代わりをやるって？勝手に暴れられるのはごめんだが、俺はお前だって…まだ……」\r\n　やがてその体勢も辛くなって、なんとかベッドまで身体を運ぶ。整えられたシーツも構わずに座り込むと、ただ呆とまた外を眺めた。\r\n　逃げたり飛び降りたりを危惧してだろう、開かない窓は風の音さえ聞かせてはくれない。ここから見える木々の仰け反りで想像するのみだった。\r\n　あんなに興味もなく、行くのも面倒であった学校が、今となってはひどく恋しい。進段の心配をしていたころが懐かしい。\r\n　…傷つけてしまった友達は、元気だろうか。シアンはああして来てくれたけれど、彼は被害者ではない。彼らがどの程度の負傷で、何を思ったのか。…死人がでたのか、きっと尋ねても真実は教えてもらえないだろう。\r\n　ウェルドは自らの両手をそっと握りしめた。\r\n　\r\n　暇だろうとグラナートが気をきかせて持ってきてくれたものやトレーニングがあったりでも、さすがに時間を潰すには限度があった。せめて読書の趣味でもあればなどと思うのだが、生まれてこのかた本など読み終えたこともない。もう長いことここで過ごしているようで、実際には1灯とて過ぎてはいない。暇というのは時を遅く感じさせる。\r\n　これからどうするのだろうか。よもやこのままというわけにもいくまい。\"それ\"は相変わらず勝手に暴れて、制御できなければ自由に外へ出ることも叶わない。\r\n　そんな青年の呑気な欲などいざ知らず、ファッジュでは抗議が起こっていた。\r\n　「いい加減にしてください、院長。これじゃ悪化するばかりです。彼は施設に入れるべきだ。」\r\n　まくしたてるようにサラテリへ抗議するのは、アエンカという青年だった。彼だけではない、周りのものも結論を求めるように横目にうかがっている。\r\n　「アエンカの言うとおりですよ。……シラアイさんは、もう退院できるほど良くなっていたのに、あの子のせいで意思さえ保てなくなってしまった。」\r\n　「せめて戸締まりは再度確認してくださいよ。」\r\n　ざわざわと部屋が騒がしくなるが、そのほとんどが同じ方に向かっていた。矢先の医者は謝罪で口を濁したが、鍵を閉め忘れたことはおろか、確認を怠ったことさえないのになと不審を秘める。\r\n　医院者からのウェルドの評判は頗る悪かった。そのような近況で予定を変更しなくて良いものかと悩むのだが、さすがにおいそれと外せる用でもなく、考えるだけで終わってしまう。\r\n　「どうかしたんですか？」\r\n　「ああ、いや……近々院集会がありましてね。本は見つかりました？」\r\n　「院長って大変ですね。ええ、これです。手続きをお願いします。」\r\n　医者は指された背を摘まんで取り出すと、そのままカウンターまで向かって担当者に本と紙切れを差し出す。\r\n　本館二階には入院者向けの図書室がある。患者か医者、手伝い人ならば誰でも自由に本を借りることができる。広さもあり、休憩所も兼ねていたため利用者は多かった。借りるでなければ見舞いに来た一般人も入ることはできる。とある事情から一人では借りられない患者に付き添ってサラテリはそこへ訪れているのだった。\r\n　情報整理音を待ちながらふと奥の棚をうかがう。高くそびえる可動式の棚に興味のあるものは比較的少なく、ぱらぱらと人がいるかいないかという景色であった。\r\n　癖のようにあの人は元気そうだとか無意識に確認し、視線を戻そうとして見えた人影に振り返る。処理を終えて本を渡そうとした係りの者に驚かれて我に返り、何でもないと苦笑いして受け取り、患者へと手渡す頃にはもはやどこにも見受けられなかったが、見間違いとも思えずに心の片隅に寄せておくのだった。\r\n　―彼が、ここにいるはずはないのに。\r\n　\r\n　ウェルドは意識を失って尚子を守るように抱える者の前で立ち尽くしていた。その頬は赤黒く汚れていたが、視点が定まらぬ表情が、それは彼自身の傷でないことを物語っていた。辺りには幼子の鳴き声が響いている。\r\n　駆けつけた医院者が避難を誘導しながら牽制したが彼は顔を向けることさえしない。\r\n　「…どうかしたのかい。」\r\n　「…わっかんね。うーん、殺せばいいのかな、やっぱ。」\r\n　人物に目星をつけつつサラテリが静かに問う。受け答えこそすれ、相変わらずつかみどころのない口調であった。\r\n　足元に散らばった―おそらくは入ってきたときに割ったのだろう―ガラスの欠片が目を光らせている。\r\n　「そんなことをしても、君は満たされないだろう？」\r\n　「あんたにわかるか？」\r\n　「何かを傷つけて得られるものなどないよ。」\r\n　「さあて、どうかね。……少なくともあいつは傷つけるとよろこ」\r\n　向き直りもせずぼうと前方を見つめたままであったが、不自然に声が止まると青年は目をつぶって一度笑うように息をはき、くるりと医者へ向き直った。\r\n　「なあ、ダファディルってのはどうだろうか？なかなかいいセンスしてると思うんだけどなー。」\r\n　突然なんの話やらと眉を寄せたのに気づいてか彼は今までで一番全うな会話をした。\r\n　「おれの名前！便利だろ。」\r\n　「…自分で決めたのかい？」\r\n　「勿論。あいつらがつけてくれるはずもないからな。」\r\n　自惚れるように得意気に何度か己が名となる言葉を繰り返す。医者は一度だけ周りには誰もいないことを改めて確認すると会話を続ける。\r\n　「君は彼らのことが嫌いかい。」\r\n　「は？何でそう思うの？」\r\n　「うまくやっていない気がしてね。」\r\n　ダファディルはむっと口を寄せる。\r\n　「…ウェルドのことは好きだぜ。シャトルーズは、まあ、よくわからん。向こうがおれを良く思ってないだけだって。」\r\n　「それは君がこういうことをするからだろう？」\r\n　「…………さてね。」\r\n　青年は両手をあげわざとらしい伸びをする。その腕が下がる頃には笑みも消えていた。\r\n　「……すみません、俺、またこんなとこに来てるんですね。」\r\n　挑戦していく輝きを完全に失った瞳で彼は自ら部屋へと歩みを進めるのだった。\r\n　\r\n　「……どういうことだ？」\r\n　呟かれた言葉は聞き飽きるほど慣れない自分の声であった。とはいえ近頃はそれも増えたなとまた彼は光を失う。\r\n　「先生は忙しいからしばらくはここにいないってこと。」\r\n　それでも先程までがそうであったように、他人の前ではそれなりを繕っているのだが。\r\n　「それを伝えに来たのか。\r\n　そ。直接回って話しながら状況も確認してるんじゃねーのか？」\r\n  ウェルドは面倒くさそうに天井を仰ぎながら答える。周りには誰もいないから、大きな独り言もさして恥ずかしさはないが、どうしても彼を好きにはなれない。かといってもう一人のそれがましとも思えぬが。\r\n　「…少々不安だな。\r\n　へえ、お前が人を信用してたのか？」\r\n　済ました顔で首を振る。すぐに口をゆがめたが、その何とも言えぬ心地悪さは拭えなかった。\r\n　「あの医者は頭領なのだろう？目の届かぬ所ならと考えるのが下につくものの常だ。\r\n　ふーん、知った風な口調だな。…なんだか最近変だぞ、お前。」\r\n　ウェルドにとってシャトルーズとは、ただいるだけの存在であった。どちらかというと気分に近かった。何をするわけでもない、そもそも何もできぬと思っていたのだが。まるで何もかも知っているかのような口振りが多い。始めのうちこそ他人の手前強がっているだけかと気にしなかったが、どうもそうでないような気がする。\r\n　「買いかぶりすぎだ。俺はお前ほど器用ではない。せいぜい、代わりに立つことくらいしかできないさ。」\r\n　すとんと落ちるように自分だけを取り戻す。眠ったという例えが面白いだろうか。\r\n　今でも、自分でもわかる簡単なことが理解できていないようであるのに、反面自分では思ってもみなかったことに気づいているようだ。正直なところ、悔しくも確かにと思ってしまう。周りからの評価など人並み以下にしか気にしていなかったが、考えてみれば自分など厄介でしかない。事実、主治医のサラテリ以外は大した会話をした覚えがない。そもそも部屋から出るなとは言われているが。\r\n　「頼むから暴れてくれるなよ、俺……」\r\n　\r\n　しかし、そのような上辺な儚い想いなど、彼が受け取るはずもなかった。\r\n　青年は机の上に立ち、おそらくは客であろう者の顔を掴んでいた。苦しそうにもがく足がぶらぶらと揺れている。\r\n　「こら、離しなさい！……ったく、言わんこっちゃない。おい、今朝食事を届けたのは誰だ？」\r\n　そこは本館にある一般食堂であった。既に多くの医院者が集まっていたが、周囲のパニックの対処やらで元凶を抑え込めずにいる。\r\n　「そ、それが…きちんと閉めたんですよ。数人で確認もしました…」\r\n　「別館ともなれば脱出も易くはないはずなのに…」\r\n　「そんなことは後だ！今はあの人を助けないと…！」\r\n　誰かが狂った笑みを浮かべてその場を離れた。\r\n　「ふふ、たのしい？ねえ…」\r\n　「ふざけたことを言っていないでその人を離しなさい！」\r\n　「おれはオーマジメだぜ？」\r\nにこにこと無邪気な笑みからも調子に乗ったような口調からもそのようなことが信じられるかと舌打ちが聞こえた。\r\n　「うーん、……そっか。」\r\n　停止した空気を破って青年はぽいと持っていた者を放る。落ちてきた被害者を慌てて受け止めようとして幾人かが潰れた。\r\n　勢いづいて追いかけようと、道を塞ごうと彼は軽々かわして、医院者同士がぶつかる始末。とはいえ彼らも闇雲に突っ走っていたわけではない。\"本気で捕まえようとしている\"体が欲しかったのだ。\r\n　やがてとある人物が戻ってくる。手には何やら厳重管理されたような鞄をさげ、青年から少し離れてそれを開ける。\r\n　「……あー、もう、わかった。降参だ。好きにしていいから。」\r\n　その様子をちらと確認して先頭にいた医者が軽く手をあげる。目までつぶって油断を見せたのにウェルドは拍子抜けしてしまう。\r\n　「なんだ、もういいのか？案外薄情だねぇ」\r\n　「何とでも言え。もう私らは諦めるよ。」\r\n　器用に掴んでいた天井の窪みから手を離し、青年はぽんと机上に飛び降りる。周りのものは下からただ見つめるだけのようだ。\r\n　彼はひとつ頷くと、そのまま床へと足場を移す―そのときだった。\r\n　それまで気も力も抜けたような様子だった医院者らが一斉に動きだし、彼の肩や足を捕らえる。驚いて一瞬だけ成されるまま身動きを封じられ、ちくりと何かが当たって、我に返ると抑えていた彼らの手を振り払って再び机へと飛び乗る。\r\n　「っ……てめえら、だまし……」\r\n　ウェルドは怒りの形相で一番近くの医院者を睨み付けるが、すぐに焦点が定まらなくなって、足元がふらついて落っこちた。\r\n　「…？？？/＆＊＊^！>$？？％<$！？」\r\n　頭を抱えて奇声を発し、力なくその場でじたばたと暴れている。そんな様を涼しい顔で見つめてやれやれとため息をつく者もいれば、ようやく一仕事終わると気を緩める者もいた。\r\n　「…全く、始めからこうすりゃ良かったんだよ。院長は優しいというより甘すぎるな。」\r\n　「おい、誰かこいつを部屋へ運べ。残りの者はこの部屋を片すぞ」\r\n　青年は手足こそ動かしていたが、掴めば容易に抑えられるほど周りを認識していなかった。手伝い人が言われた通り、いつもの不服顔でコーリカマスへと詰め込んでいく。\r\n　彼の感じた違和感は「チンセイザイ」という薬によるものであった。早い話、意思や心といわれる主観を一時的な混沌へと叩き落とす代物で、うたれると思考や感情が分別なく入り乱れ、自己防衛のために意識を手放す。そうして強制的に鎮めることができるのだ。身体的な後遺症はないとされているが、その経験は心に傷を負わせ、加えてその苦痛は見ているだけで容易に想像がついてしまう故に乱用は禁止されていたが、今回使用を非難する者はいなかった。それだけ”彼”は彼らにとって害悪と見なされていたのだ。\r\n　別館へとやって来た手伝い人らは乱暴にウェルドをベッドへと放ると鍵をかけてそそくさと部屋を出ていく。もはや彼の意識は悪夢ごと奥底へと沈み込んでいて、何も知らぬ彼が呑気にあくびをした。\r\n　ウェルドはどこかだるい感覚を誤魔化そうと頬を叩いてみたりぴょんと跳ねたりしてみて、違和感に首をかしげたが、一向に解答を得られそうにない。さきほどまで一体何をしていただろうか。いつの間にか眠ってしまったのか、それとも……\r\n　これ以上考えを巡らせても仕方ないかと青年は窓際にやや長く伸びる机の引き出しに手をかける。既にいくつかの物が整理されないながらに収まっていた。それらを無造作に机上へと取り出し、無意識のような手馴れた様子で\"所定の\"位置へ並べていく。理解できぬと眉をひそめたのも塗りつぶして、ペンを握るのだった。\r\n\r\n　配膳係の手伝い人は覚悟を決めて扉を開けた。係は順番に回っていたが、何もこのタイミングでなくともと巡り合わせを恨む。\r\n　しかし予想に反し、隔たりのなくなった先を覗いても、そこに青年の姿は見受けられなかった。遮光布が部屋を薄暗く不気味にさせていたが、それ以外はひどく平穏なものであった。不思議に思うも、幸運と思い持ってきた物を奥の机へと置き、さっさと帰ってしまおうと振り返る。彼はそこにいた。\r\n　「よくもっ･･･！」\r\n　手伝い人の口から悲鳴が上がるより早く、ウェルドは彼女の頬を殴った。叫びは鈍い苦痛の音に変わる。近くに人はいない。彼が続けて首をつかむと、振り上げた反対の手に握る銀を僅かに差し込んだ空の明かりが照らし、目を丸くした手伝い人は慌ててじたばたと暴れたが、怒りを交えたその笑みにやがて抵抗もできなくなる。刃物の先が首筋に当たり汗が垂れる。\r\n　「っ………う…るさい……」\r\n　が、それ以上深く、刺さる前にウェルドは身を引いた。頭を押さえるようにぶつぶつと何かを言っていたようだが、彼女にとってはどうでも良いことだった。部屋を飛び出し、一目散に本館への階段へ駆け寄り外へと出ていった。\r\n　「……あいつ等は、おれたちにヒドイコトしたんだぞ？！」\r\n　床へと座り込んだ彼は刃を持たない手で頭を押さえたまま哀しそうに声を荒げる。\r\n　「それはお前がふざけたことをするからだ…！」\r\n　受け答えるのも彼自身の声だった。彼はいつの間にか\"目の前\"にいた。\r\n　「何を…おれはただ、お前の」\r\n　「聞きたくない！」\r\n　目も開けられずにふらふらと膝で立って頭を振る。\r\n　「お前たちなんか…嫌いだっ…お前らなんか…\r\n…ウェルド……\r\n消えてくれ、頼むから…」\r\n　ことりと物音がすると、青年は両の肩を反対の腕で押さえ深呼吸する。扉からの廊下の照明にも、窓側の布の隙間からの光へも、どちらもすがる気にはなれない。\r\n　やがて廊下の光が遮られるのだが、彼はそのことも覚えてはいなかった。\r\n　\r\n　「ああ、面会ね。ほら、どうぞ。くれぐれも施錠は忘れずに。」\r\n　無造作にカウンターのテーブルに鍵を放られてシアンは訝る。\r\n　「あの、ちょっと乱暴すぎませんか？」\r\n　「え？だって君は顔が知れてるし…場所もわかるだろう？」\r\n　そうしてしばらく押し問答を続けていたのだが、受付の態度は変わらず少年は頬を膨らませながら広告も期限の過ぎている廊下を進んだ。\r\n　「ウェルド、入ってもいいか？」\r\n　「ああ。」\r\n　戸を開け中へ入るとウェルドも不思議そうな顔をする。\r\n　「……お前一人？」\r\n　「そうなんだよ。結構いい加減だよな。場所知ってるなら勝手に行けーだなんて。」\r\n　シアンは憤りをぶつける先を見つけてつい口走るが、すぐに察すると目をそらした。\r\n　「あ…ごめん。こんな話をしにきたんじゃないのに。」\r\n　「いいさ、別に。」\r\n　なんとなく和んで青年は穏やかに苦笑いする。シアンは整理された椅子の中から一つをウェルドの側へ持って行くと、そこへ腰掛けながら話しかける。\r\n　「寝てたのか？」\r\n　「ん…ああ、最近なんだか気だるくて。」\r\n　「そう…まあ、退屈だよね。何かあればいいんだけど…」\r\n　「お前だって忙しいだろ？そろそろ虹催だもんな。」\r\n　シアンは頷いて悲しそうに微笑む。\r\n　「うん…アスだよ。グラナートさんもそれで来られないって。」\r\n　「お前はいいのかよ。」\r\n　「ちょっとくらいね。」\r\n　虹催直前、授業もなく出し物をするクラスが追い込みをかける大切な時間であるのはウェルドも承知していた。それでも見舞いに来てくれる友人に、感謝しながらも本当にお人好しだなと思う。\r\n　「最近どう？”彼ら”は。」\r\n　「え…？いや、まあ…なんとか落ち着いてるかな。」\r\n　ウェルドは咄嗟に、心配させまいと適当な言葉を並べる。やや目を逸らしたおかしな態度ではあったが、シアンは期待からかあまり気にしていないようであった。\r\n　「ほんと？じゃあさ、ちょっとくらい虹催に行けないだろうか？ほら、気分転換にもなるし…」\r\n　けれどもそれは失敗だったなと後悔する。今の自分の立場では誰に頼んでも外出許可の出るはずがない。\r\n　「さすがにそれはどうだろう…ほら、学校で始めに事起こしてるわけだし…」\r\n　「そっか…そうだよね。」\r\n　シアンはすとんと乗り出した身を戻しため息をつく。その瞳に宿った影は、ここに来る少し前の事を思い出したためであった。\r\n\r\n　彼はウェルドの暇つぶしになるならと、気が紛れるならと課題や授業用紙でも届けようかと思い立ち、教員室へ向かっていた。勿論親友がそれを面倒くさがっていたことは知っているが、それは間違いなく\"これまで\"であったからだ。\r\n　定型の礼をして入っていく。普段は関わりのない教師―ウェルドの担任―を見つけると、挨拶をした。\r\n　「こんにちは、僕は４段のシアン・シュプリームと言います。ウェルドの友人なのですが、彼のクラスで何か課題などはありませんか」\r\n　そのようなことを尋ねたのだが相手はきょとんとして瞬きする。\r\n　「…えーと、どうしたんだい？それに、『ウェルド』って…？」\r\n　驚いたのはシアンも同じであった。場に無言(しじま)が続く。\r\n　沈黙を破ったのはその状況に気づいたシアンの担任であった。彼女は慌てているのを悟られないよう静かに駆け寄ると、\r\n　「シュプリーム君？ちょうどよかった。少し来てくれ。いや、すみませんね…ははは」\r\n　半ば強引にシアンを連れていく。彼も戸惑いながらも、返事をするととりあえずその言葉に従った。教員室を出て廊下を歩き、小部屋へと入って一つ息をはくと、くるりと向きをかえて担任は呟いた。\r\n　「ここならいいかな。」\r\n　「あの…」\r\n　「ああ、ごめんね。そういえば君も彼とは仲がよかったんだったね…」\r\n　シアンが説明を求めると、教師は顔つきを変える。嫌なことでも思い出すような酔いしれた表情だ。\r\n　「今、彼のことには触れないでくれ。特に３段の関係者には。…あんなことがあったんだ、皆忘れてしまいたいんだよ。」\r\n　「そんな…まさか、」\r\n　教師は頷くと窓の外を見つめ補足する。\r\n　「彼は学生想いの教師でね、その場にいなかったとはいえ傷ついた子たちを見て悩乱したんだろう。生徒たちも、必死に笑ってはいるけど傷心していると思うよ。」\r\n　「けど、だからって忘れて言い訳が…」\r\n　「わかっているさ。皆頭では。別に彼だけが悪い訳じゃない。それなりの理由もあるだろう。でも、今は…」\r\n　教師は面と向かって微笑む。まるで辛いのは自分も同じだと言わんばかりに。\r\n　そうしてシアンは無理矢理ウェルドの話題を出さないことを約束させられ、例の思いつきもあきらめざるを得なかったのだった。\r\n\r\n　「シアン、どうかしたのか。」\r\n　ウェルドに呼びかけられてはっと我に返る。彼はちょっと思い出したことがあるだけだと苦笑いしてやり過ごす。\r\n　「でさ、お前んとこは何やるんだ？」\r\n　「え？うん、演劇をやるよ。」\r\n　内容を知ってげっと慌てたのはウェルドだった。\r\n　「尚更抜け出したらまずいだろっほら、帰った帰った！」\r\n　「大丈夫だって、僕は道具制作の係でもう終わってるから…」\r\n　それでも何かあったらどうするんだとウェルドは帰らせようとする。そんな彼にシアンは俯いて白状した。\r\n　「…ほんと言うとね、少し嫌なんだ。」\r\n　「え？」\r\n　「何事もないように時が過ぎていく。これでいいのかなって、よく思うからさ…」\r\n　項垂れたままぽつりと呟くシアンに友はわざとらしくため息をつく。なんだと彼も思わず顔をあげた。\r\n　「お前はフロスか何かか？出来ることなんかたかが知れてるんだ。どんなに嫌でも、結局はなるようにしかならないさ。」\r\n　彼は”何事もなかった”かのように爽やかに笑っていた。それがひどく無知で哀れで……何よりも強かった。\r\n　「…そうだね、ごめん。」\r\n　「俺の分まで楽しんでこいよ。」\r\n　「ああ。」\r\n　きっと嫌なことはたくさんあるだろうに。思い通りにならないことなど、他人より多いだろうに。シアンは手を振ると、また来るからと音をたてないように扉をゆっくり閉めた。\r\n\r\n学習能力が低いのか、それ以上の何かがあるのかなどは医院者らの知ったところではない。ただ目の前に悶え転がる彼を見下し、淡々と仕事をするのみであった。このような目に遭うのはこれで3回目。相変わらず\"彼\"は暴れることをやめなかったが、それでもはじめの頃より抑えるのは幾らか楽であった。\"チンセイザイ\"を見せれば反射的に動きが鈍る。数人でかかるだけですぐに取り押さえることができた。あとはこうして鎮めればいい。\r\n　「ほら、暴れただけ苦しむんだ。そろそろやめにしないか。」\r\n　「……～～～～っ-………」\r\n目元を押さえていた手の片方が勢いだけよく医院者の足首をつかむ。歩く程度で振り払えそうなほど弱々しいものであったが、図らずも鬱憤晴らしになりつつあった彼はそうはせず、そのまましゃがむとその腕を掴み返した。\r\n　「おやおや、今回はもう一回いっとくか？」\r\n　「おい、さすがにやめとけよ。」\r\n　「構わんだろ。慣れてきたのかもしれない。」\r\nおそらく止めた者も\"彼\"の心配などはしていなかったのだろう。それ以上は何も言わず、むしろその様に痛快ささえおぼえていた。\r\n　ちくりと腕に痛みが走る。恨みを抱えていた彼の表情はみるみる青ざめ、声を出すことさえできないようでただ震えていた。―そうして、彼は早急に意識をそのままに奥へと引っ込んでしまったのだ。\r\n　そんな状態とは露知らず、いつものように手伝い人らは荷詰めを始める。慣れたような頼りない手つきで作業を進めながらぼそりと\r\n　「端から動けないようにすればいいのに」\r\nなどと愚痴を漏らした。\r\n　「どういうことだ？」\r\n　「ほら、食事に\"スイミンヤク\"を混ぜるとか…」\r\n　しかしその提案には誰もが乗り気ではなかった。さすがに\"基本人格\"にまで害を及ぼすことは明らかであったからだ。彼らは\"彼\"に恨みなどない。\r\n　聞き入れられぬことは見越していたのか、手伝い人らはそれ以上は何も言わずにそそくさと部屋を出ていった。\r\n　揺られる内にも彼は闇の中をさ迷う。果てしなく狭くて息苦しいほど広い空間に押しづめられてひとりぼっち。それが何よりも当たり前の真理なのだと疑うことさえできずに。\r\n　それから\"彼\"が暴れることはなかった。大人しく部屋にこもり、食事にさえ手をつけようとせず配膳の係りをただ静かに見つめるばかりであった。サラテリが帰ってきたのは、そんな頃であった。\r\n　彼は順々に部屋を回り容態や状態を確認しつつ挨拶をしていく。無論留守を預かっていた医院者らからの報告もあるのだが、それでよしとはしなかった。\r\n　ウェルドのいる部屋は別館に位置することもあり、必然的に最後に訪れることになる。彼はノックと呼び掛けの後に返事がないのを不審に思いながらそっと扉を開ける。眠っているのかもしれないという予想とは裏腹に、彼は寝床の上で静かに座っていた。\r\n　が、医者の姿を認識するなりびくりと跳ねて眼光を鋭くする。顔は両手で覆われ、表情こそ正確に見えなかったが、感情は用意に知ることができた。\r\n　医者は固唾をのみこむと極力刺激しないように優しく話しかけた。\r\n　「久しぶり、ウェルド君。…どうかしたのかい？」\r\n　「……………………」\r\n　あまりいい状態ではないなと髭を撫でていると机の上の冷めた朝食が目に留まった。\r\n　「ああ、食事がまだみたいだね。食べられそうに…」\r\n　「いやだっ…\"スイミンヤク\"がはいってるんだ……また、おかしくなる…」\r\n　打ち切った言葉にまさか、と医者はかけより、持ち合わせの何やらで確認したが、特に異常はなさそうだと知るとますます状況が悪化していることに冷や汗を流す。\r\n　「…大丈夫、そんなものは入ってないよ。」\r\n　「……？先生、なんでここに……」\r\n　先程までの怯えはどこへやら、青年はすっかり平穏な表情を取り戻して手を下ろす。が、それも束の間、瞳孔を見開くと罵詈雑言と共に頭を抱えうずくまってしまうのだった。\r\n　医者は下手に声をかけるべきではないと一言だけ挨拶すると、受付に面会拒否を依頼してファッジュへと飛んでいき、何やら話をしていたアエンカたちを捕まえて問い詰める。\r\n　「私が留守の間、ウェルド君に何をした？」\r\n　「え、いえ……彼には、何も……」\r\n　曖昧な言い回しにはあ、とサラテリは一つため息をつく。\r\n　「…質問を変えよう。\"ダファディル\"君は暴れたかい。」\r\n　向かう3人ほどの医者は誰も院長の目を見ようとしない。\r\n　「…どう抑えた？」\r\n　「それは……」\r\n　少しの間はそのまま黙りこんでいたが、ようやく彼らはこれまでの経緯を説明する。\r\n　「……\"チンセイザイ\"を使用するどころか、一度に2回も投与するなんて…呆れてものも言えないな。」\r\n　「け、けど、あれは意識がなくなれば切れるでしょう！？…それに、あれから大人しくなりましたし……」\r\n　「意識を手放すでなく\"交代\"したんだろう。大人しくなればいいというものでもないだろうに…」\r\n　ひとまず彼らの処遇は後で考えるとして、状況を理解したサラテリは再び別館へと足を運んだ。相変わらず返事のない扉を開ける。彼はこちらに背を向けて机に向かっているようであった。ノートや筆記具は妹に持ってきてもらったのだろうー売店には売っているが彼では行くことはできないはずであるー淡々と筆記音が部屋に響き渡る。\r\n　医者は深くは入らずにその背に謝罪する。\r\n　「すまない。…酷いことをした。辛かったろう……」\r\n　答えはない。\r\n　「本当に、こんなことになってしまって……」\r\n　かり、と音が途切れたのは彼がようやく医者に気づいたからではなかった。かたりと置かれたペンが少しだけ転がる。\r\n　「信用など、するべきではなかった。『ウェルド』は酷く混乱している。……もう、お前にも\"シアン\"にも任せない。」\r\n　彼は無を纏いゆっくり席を立つ。言われもない威厳が恐怖を煽り、まっすぐ出入り口へ向かう青年の前に立ちはだかるべきという考えさえ及ばない。なんとか出たのは言葉だけであった。\r\n　「ま、待ってくれ。外に出たら今度は治安維持局が君を…」\r\n　「その程度は問題ない。」\r\n　「え…？」\r\n　真意を確かめるより早く、出ていこうとする\"それ\"に銀が舞い込んできた。驚きを落ち着け確認してみれば、少女が顔をあげ、遅れておってきたであろう受付係が息を切らしていた。\r\n　「すみません、どうしてもと押しきられて……」`","\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nimport

`　「シェブロン、そっちはまずいって！」\r\n　後ろを追う少年がそう諭しても、頭に血がのぼっているせいか正面の少年の歩みは止まらなかった。そればかりか、人が寄り付かないのは都合が良いと開き直って目的地へと変える始末。どうしてこうも伝承を信じていないのか、追跡する少年には理解できなかった。\r\n　二人の少年は、というよりも前を行く少年はとある人物から逃げていた。理由は簡単。よくある親子喧嘩。とはいえ彼は単なる喧嘩だとは思っていない。本当に怒っている。今度ばかりはもうこんなところへ帰るものかと、家出を考えているんだ、と。追いかけている少年―リアンにとっては、いつものことにすぎないのだが。\r\n　そうしてシェブロンが向かっていたのは、村民が避けている森だった。彼らが言うには、世界の唯一神がそこに住んでいるらしいが、その真偽は定かではない。そもそも神なんて曖昧なものを、シェブロンは信じていなければ概念さえ認識していなかった。\r\n　伝説の森と村との明確な境界はわからない。周囲を山なり森なり木々で囲まれた村なのだ。なんとなくそちらへ向かっていける細い道がある程度。つまりはその道を辿ることが禁止されていた。\r\n　そろそろ道の中ほどまで来てしまったのではないだろうか。勢いで追って来たが、自分まで約束を破って入るなど、許されたことではない。そう不安になったリアンが、一度背後を振り返ってみた。人影はない。\r\n　「ねえ、やっぱり戻ろうよ」\r\n　シェブロンに向かって発したのだろう。戻した視線の先から忽然と彼の姿は消え、うっそうと繁る森が目の前に広がっているばかりだった。\r\n　「シェブロン？！どこへ行ったの、冗談やめてよ！」\r\n　深緑が不安を煽るように揺れて、少年の悲鳴を真似た。村の約束事になくとも、彼は森に良い思い出がない。\r\n　「ねえ！！」\r\n　どれだけ叫んでも、己の声が空しく響くばかりで、誰かに届くことはなかった。\r\n　\r\n　＊\r\n　\r\n　シェブロンがそのことに気づいたのは、落ちていた枝につま付きそうになって図らずも後ろを振り返った時だった。\r\n　「んだよ、帰ったのか…」\r\n　少し前から声が聞こえなくなっていたことには気づいていた。けれどもてっきり説得を諦めたためと思っていた。…追いかけるのを諦めたようだ。\r\n　―そういえば、足音も聞こえなかったかな\r\n　彼はようやく冷静さを取り戻して反省する。少し幼稚すぎた。何でも言うことを聞くのは、格好悪いと決めつけていた。大切なのはそれが正しいか見極めることだと言うのに…\r\n　シェブロンは一度ため息をつくと、そのまま振り返る。そうだ、謝りに行こう。その文句を考えながら、1歩を踏み出そうと足をあげる…\r\n　―と。\r\n　「遊ばないのか？」\r\n　背後から、どこか聞き覚えのある声がした。シェブロンは出した足をすとんと下ろすと直角ほど振り返る。それまで全く気配を感じなかった。先程のように怒りで周りが見えなくなっていたわけではないはずなのに…\r\n　声をかけたのは白く輝く少年であった。少なくとも、彼の目にはそう映っていた。年の頃ははシェブロンと同じか少し幼いくらいだろう。見慣れぬ衣服を纏って、木漏れ日の中に浮かび上がった幻影にも見える。\r\n　「…誰だ？」\r\n　村人は全員知っている。こんな子供が一人で来られるほど探索の簡単な森は村の周囲にない。\r\n　「遊ぼう？…俺と、遊びたいだろ？」\r\n　そうだとすれば。この森に住んでいる…\r\n　「もしかして、あんたがここに住んでる…なんか、偉い人…の子供？」\r\n　それくらいしか思い付かなかった。言われて少年は目をぱちくりさせて首をかしげる。\r\n　「よくわからないな。そんなことより遊ぼうよ。」\r\n　ぐいと引っ張られたようにシェブロンはひとりでに歩き出してしまう。\r\n　「ちょ、ちょっとまてって…せめて、」\r\n　「ここには誰もいないよ。さっき見て回ったんだ。」\r\n　言わんとすることに察しがついて答えた。\r\n　白い少年は待ちきれなくなって先へ駆けていく。仕方ないなとシェブロンも後を追いかけた。案内するように的確に道なき道を進んでいく。\r\n　少し前からいたのだろうか。先程も確かそんなことを言っていた。\r\n　―なんだよ、人が入り込んでるじゃないか\r\n　\r\n　ぐるぐると駆け回った先にたどり着いたのは、大きな樹であった。小さな魔物たちの多くが住みかにしているのか、あちこちから顔を出している。白い少年は彼らを見向きもせずに樹を上っていく。魔物の方が気を使って穴へ逃げ込んだ。彼も続いて樹へのぼった。\r\n　「わあ…」\r\n　それは他よりあたまいっこ高い樹だったから、周りの景色が急に小さくなって、世界でたまころ遊びでもしてしまえるかのようにさえ思えた。村も遠くに粒みたいで食べてしまえそうだ。\r\n　「気に入った？」\r\n　少年が伺うように体を傾けて微笑む。\r\n　「ああ、きもちーとこだな！」\r\n　シェブロンも笑い返してくれた。\r\n　\r\n　「あ…そろそろ帰らないと。」\r\n　木の葉を弄って遊んでいた少年が突然声を上げる。\r\n　森へ入ったのは確か…彼が朝食を終えてすぐに喧嘩したから、朝の出来事だったろう。喧嘩しているときや走っていったときはひどく長く感じたが、一緒に遊んでいる時間はその何倍もあったはずなのに短かった。いつの間にか日も紅く染まり終えている。\r\n　「嫌だ。帰っちゃいけない。」\r\n　白い少年は持っていた葉を捨てて立ち上がる。\r\n　「何言ってんだよ、さすがに仲直りしなきゃ。」\r\n　「嫌…」\r\n　それまで遊びの内容は全てシェブロンに任せるほど、彼は口出ししなかったというのに。突然わがままを言い出した少年にシェブロンは困ってしまう。\r\n　「けどほら、お前も家族とか心配するだろ…？明日また遊べばいいじゃん…」\r\n　「アスなんかない。」\r\n　その少年の声は低く恐ろしいものだった。何かの比喩だろうか…と考える余裕もなくなるほどに。\r\n　「な、何…言って…」\r\n　「お前にも俺にもアスなんかない。いずれわかる。…\"帰りたい場所がある\"なら帰ればいい。」\r\n　くるりとシェブロンへ背を向けた。拗ねてしまったのだろうか。と彼が気を使う。\r\n　「お、おい…？」\r\n　「来たいなら、また来れば良い…」\r\n　―これは要するに。\r\n　一度嫌だと言った手前、すぐに意見を変えるのが恥ずかしくなって、拗ねたようにみせているということだろうか。背伸びしたい年頃なのかなとシェブロンはクスリと和んで、じゃあ、また明日来るから。と立ち上がる。\r\n　少年が遠くに見えるくらいの位置で振り返ると、彼もまたこちらをおそるおそる伺っていた。\r\n　「じゃーな！」\r\n　シェブロンは叫ぶと、村までの道を駆けていった。\r\n　\r\n　＊\r\n　\r\n　立て付けの悪いドアからは明かりが少し漏れていた。きちんと謝ろうと腹をくくっていたはずだったが、いざ目の前にするとやっぱり家出すればよかったかなと逃げたくなっている。\r\n　いやいや、森で会った少年のわがままも振り払ってやって来たのだ。引き下がるわけにはいかない。\r\n　ぱちんと両頬を叩いて、扉の軋む音が響く。2つの影がこちらへ意識を向けた。\r\n　「シェブロン！…おまえ、こんな時間まで何してた！？」\r\n　先に声を上げたのはシェパードだった。グレンは静かに少年を見つめるだけで、ひとまずは青年に任せる体勢だ。\r\n　「う…それは…」\r\n　「ここらは魔物が山ほど出るんだ。夜は特に危険種が活発になるからな…」\r\n　「う、うるさいな…いいだろ…」\r\n　シェパード―シェブロンの義兄にあたる彼は、何かと弟に口をだすのだ。おそらくは戦闘技術が自分を越えそうでこわいのだろうと。シェブロンはそう考えている。\r\n　「シェパードの言っていることは事実だ。して、どこへいた？」\r\n　「うるさい！あーもういいよ！！」\r\n　シェブロンは反射的に叫ぶと扉を、壊れるのではというほど勢いよく閉め、一目散に来た道を戻っていった。\r\n　呆気にとらわれたシェパードは目を丸めていたが、我に返ると父とともにため息をついた。\r\n　「また、\"喧嘩してる\"とか思ってるんですかねぇ…」\r\n　「…だろうな。全く、いつも一方的に言いおって…普段はもう少し落ち着きのある子なんだが、ひとたび思い込むと客観視できなくなるらしい。」\r\n　「…ま、まだガキだからな。」\r\n　シェパードは扉に力を込めて開ける。これもそろそろ何とかしなくてはと頭の片隅で考えて靴を履き替えた。\r\n　「俺、探してきます。近頃物騒だし…」\r\n　「頼んだぞ。」\r\n　\r\n　さてリアンの家にでもまた邪魔しているだろうかと考えながら外へ出る彼の視界の端に走り去る少年が見えた。川の向こう側でまっすぐ左手に消えていく。そちらにあるのは神様の森。\r\n　よりにもよって―\r\n　シェパードはとりあえず村長宅前を曲がり、弟も通った道筋を追いながら、入って良いものかと悩む。いや、今回は仕方ない。弟を取り戻すためだ。村人は許してくれるだろう。もともと彼は神様を軽視していたのを、皆も知っているはずであるし…\r\n　そのような思考が確かに大きくあったのだが、\r\n　―このまま、追いかけずに神の怒りに触れれば。\r\n　そんないけない思いが頭のどこか奥ををよぎってもいた。振り払って素直に足を動かした。\r\n　昔に一度だけ、森を一目見ようとしたのか入り口から覗いていたことがあった。結局、道の長さや曲がりくねりでそれさえ叶わず諦めたようだが。\r\n\r\n　初めての道を駆け足で進みながら警戒を怠らないように周囲を見回す。特に変わったところはない。誰かが整備した道のように木々が生えていないこの自然道に、魔物も不気味がって寄り付かないのだ。静かなものである。\r\n　「ん？」\r\n　いくらか進んだところで、けれどもそれがおかしいことに気づく。正面に見えるあの開けた場所は…\r\n　それは気のせいなどではなかった。先程入ってきた森の入り口。奥には村が広がっている。\r\n　道は一本。まっすぐに進んでいたはずだが、どういうわけか折り返してしまったらしい。\r\n　「神様の森…ね。」\r\n　改めて、村の誰もが近づかないことに納得ができて呟く。不穏な空気が肩に掛けた布を触った。\r\n　\r\n　なんだよ、なんだよなんだよ！！せっかく仲直りしようとしてたのに！\r\n　堪えるように涙を目にいっぱい溜め込んだシェブロンが道を曲がっていく。川を越えて左手へ向かえば、元の森に\"帰れるのだ\"\r\n　―帰る？\r\n　ふわりとだけ疑問に思ったようだが、それ以上の違和感も持てずに足を止めるには至らなかった。\r\n　細い道を辿っていく。時間もあってだろうが、その間村人とは誰とも会わなかった。会わせなかった。魔物とて同じことだ。\r\n　\r\n　やがて例の森の木々がざわりと揺れて出迎える。\r\n　「やっぱり、帰ってきた。」\r\n　「お前…」\r\n　そういえば、名前も聞いてなかったなと少年は先程まで遊んでいた彼に近づく。\r\n　「あんなとこ、居心地悪いだろう？」\r\n　少年の質問にどきりとして彼は歩みを止めた。\r\n　―住みにくい？\r\n　いや、そうではない。ただ少し、素直になれないだけなのだ。謝罪の言葉が近頃うまく出てこない。\r\n　「そうじゃない…けど、今晩はここにいていいかな。」\r\n　白い少年はにこりと微笑みで返すと彼をまたぐいぐいと引っ張っていく。すぐに心地のよい緑の空間へ誘われた。その静けさと涼しさに疲れが滲み出たのか、シェブロンはすぐに眠りについてしまう。驚いてしばらく側で立っていた。\r\n　\r\n　日がのぼっても眠り続ける目の前の少年を、じっと見つめていた。何を考えて人間を招いたのだろうか、と羽を休めるため魔物が側の木へ止まって嫉妬している。\r\n　白い少年は他のものには見向きもせず、静かに彼が起きるのを待っていた。彼は約束したはずだ。キョウも来てくれるのだと。\r\n　パチリと若葉色の瞳が姿を現す。しばらくは光も受け付けずぼやけていたが、はたと状況に気づいて上体を起こした。\r\n　「…あ…そっか。俺、またここに来たんだ。」\r\n　「キョウ来ると言った。」\r\n　ぐっとシェブロンは伸びをして、大きくため息をついた。\r\n　「…うん、でも、帰らなきゃ。仲直りできてないんだ。このままはいけない。」\r\n　シェブロンはてっきり、少年は遊びたいのだと思っていた。だから、こうしてまた寂しそうな顔で見つめてくるのだ。と。\r\n　「…悪い。な、明日遊ぶから。」\r\n　「…約束した。」\r\n　コクりと申し訳なさそうに頷いて村への一本道へ足を向ける。さらさらとそよ風が背中を押した。\r\n　道を半ばほど来た頃だった。はっと後ろの気配に気づいてシェブロンは振り向く。案の定、後ろには彼がいて、静かにそちらを見つめていた。それが見送りならば、手を振って笑顔を返しただろう。けれども少年は、不適な笑みで目を細めていたのだ。シェブロンは恐ろしくなって、慌てて道を駆けていった。\r\n　\r\n　村で始めに出くわしたのはリアンだった。彼はひどく驚いた様子で、言葉が出ないのか口をパクパクとさせていた。シェブロンがそんな様に吹き出すと、リアンも実感がわいたのかわっと泣き出して声をあげた。\r\n　「シェブロン、よかった…もう、どこへ行っていたんだ！」\r\n　「あ、はは…ちょっとな。」\r\n　二人は村の申し訳程度に敷かれた道を歩いていく。いくら無断で立ち入ったとはいえ、少し大袈裟すぎやしないだろうか…しかしその疑問は、次の友の言葉で別の疑問へ変わる。\r\n　「相変わらずだなぁ…もう15日《ジャク》も行方不明だったってのに…」\r\n　「え…」\r\n　シェブロンが驚いた顔をみせるとリアンは何を言っているのだとまた呆れる。詳しく説明を求めれば、シェパードが彼を見失ってから天は30回反転したのだと少年は怒った。\r\n　「…気づいてなかったの？」\r\n　「いや、そんなはずは…」\r\n　シェブロンの記憶では、確かにあの森では1ジャクだけ過ごした…兄から逃げてからなら、1晩明かしただけである。彼は自分の中でそうまとめると、リアンに弁解するべく口を開けた。が、\r\n　「シェブロン！お前今までどこに…！」\r\n　「げっあにき…」\r\n　「げ、じゃない！」\r\n　内容も忘れて踵を返す。けれども側にいた友にそうはさせぬと襟元を捕まれた。\r\n　「離せリアン！裏切りもの！」\r\n　「シェブロン…グレンさんやシェパードさんに謝るべきだ。」\r\n　兄もそうだと腕を組む。そういえば自分とて、そうすべきだと帰ってきたというのに。どうしてか、目の前にすると逃げ出したくなってしまう。…今までこうも離れたいとは思わなかったのに。…きっと、森の居心地が良すぎたのだろう。\r\n　「そ、そりゃ…そうだけど。」\r\n　リアンに解放されると彼は渋々家へと帰った。\r\n　\r\n　晩が過ぎ、それまでの常であったようにリアンはシェブロンの元を訪れる。とはいえキョウは妹のフェアアイルもついてきた。\r\n　「なんだよ、いつもは雑貨屋の真似事なんかしてるのにさ。」\r\n　「ま、真似事じゃないわよ！手伝ってるの…！…それに……」\r\n　せっかくシェブロンが帰ってきたのだから…と彼女はぼそぼそと続ける。家では強がってそのうち帰ってくるなどと言っていたのに、やっぱり心配だったのだなとリアンはくすりと笑った。\r\n　「シェブロン！遊ぼう。」\r\n　ノックもせずに開け放ち声をあげたリアンを、フェアアイルが注意する。彼はいつものことだと気にする風もなかったが。\r\n　「ん…リアン、それにフェアアイルも…」\r\n　「あ、まだ朝食中？じゃあ外で待って\r\n　「シェブロン！…よかったぁ…」\r\n　シェブロンが開けた皿を洗い場へ運ぼうと立ち上がったところでフェアアイルが彼へと飛び付き、キラリと少年の耳飾りが光る。\r\n　「ちょ、ちょっとフェアアイル！」\r\n　「ほんとに、心配したんだから…」\r\n　その光景に慌てたのは兄のリアンだけで、奥にいたシェパードは苦笑いし、シェブロンにいたってはさすが双子、と反応の差異の少なさに感心する始末であった。\r\n　やがて落ち着いたフェアアイルがハッとして謝りながら照れながら離れ、真っ赤になった顔を隠すように兄の後ろへと隠れた。\r\n　「えーと…遊ぶって話だよな……」\r\n　シェブロンはちらと後ろを伺う。シェパードが片付けを終えて階段をのぼるところであった。\r\n　「…悪い、先約があって…」\r\n　「え？誰と？」\r\n　「いや、それは、まぁ…」\r\n　笑って彼は誤魔化す。あの森によその人がいたなどと言ったら、村中大騒ぎになってしまう、そう考えてだろう。いくら仲の良い相手とはいえ、村人に心配をかけさせたくはない。\r\n　そうしてなんとか村を抜け出し、周囲を警戒して森へと足を踏み入れ、会いに来てくれる。そう決まっている。\r\n　がさがさと木の葉が我先に来客を知らせに来る。水が準備にさざ波をたて、風は讃歌の練習始めた。\r\n　何を喚こうが気にもならないが、片隅程度にわかってるじゃないかと口許が緩む。\r\n　―おいで、シェブロン。\r\n　\r\n　ぱきりと更に小枝が割れた。\r\n　少年は以前より慎重に辺りを見回して歩みを進める。これだけ広い森なのだ。人間では約束をしていても必ず会える保証はない。すれ違いに姿を見合うことさえ叶わないかもしれない。\r\n　ポツリと雫が葉から飛び降りて振り向いた先に、白い少女がいた。シェブロンは一度目を逸らしたがすぐに不機嫌に顔を寄せてため息をつき、倒れた木に静かに座る少女へ問いかける。\r\n　「一人か？」\r\n　少女は何も言わずに口だけで笑って、シェブロンを見つめていた。\r\n　「こんなところにいると危ないぞ。迷ったんなら村まで案内するけど……」\r\n　その言葉に違和感を覚えて、少女は唖然とし、すぐにクスクスと手で隠すように笑う。何がおかしいのかと目を丸めながら、シェブロンはその仕草に頬を赤らめる。あまり気にしていなかったが、随分と綺麗な子であった。目こそ前髪に覆われはっきりしないものの、肌はつややかで、髪は透き通るように風に遊んでいる。軽く握った小さな手は、捕まえていないと消えてしまいそうだ。\r\n　「今日はなにして遊ぶ？」\r\n　我に返ったとき少女は既に立ち上がり、シェブロンに向けて上体を傾けていた。\r\n　「え…あそぶ？……まさか、君は……」\r\n　「前に遊んだじゃない。」\r\n　恐らくは目的の人物であろう。しかし、\r\n　「け、けど…前と顔が……」\r\n　一目で解らぬほど姿が異なっていた。見た目くらいしか判断材料のない彼には仕方のないことなのかもしれないが、その認識は邪魔だと思う。\r\n　「そんなもの、私には関係ないの。姿も、言葉も、全部私だから。」\r\n　少女はいつかのように手招きして奥へと誘う。そういうものだろうかと戸惑っていたシェブロンだが、彼自身も気がつかぬ間に足は森の奥へと身体を運んでいった。\r\n　\r\n　それからまた、寂しそうな様子を見せる\"それ\"に負けて次の約束をしてしまい、「約束がある」「やりたいことがある」「ちょっと一人で考えたいから…」などと様々言い訳して、やがて嘘もきつくなった頃、昼は目立ちすぎると夜の間に出掛けるようになり…彼の村と森とでの二重生活は幾日か続いた。\r\n　いくら元気のあるシェブロンとはいえ、昼にリアンらといつも通り遊び、夜に寝る間もなく遠慮のなくなった少年の相手をする生活に限界を向かえていた。`","\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\nimport
